## Year 4: Why Do We Believe?

**Age Range**: 9-10 years (school Year 4)  
**Core Themes**: Faith and reason, the Creed, dealing with doubt, Catholic identity  
**Primary Sources**:
- Catechism of the Catholic Church: ¬ß¬ß26-184, 185-1065
- Bible: Hebrews 11:1-3; 1 Peter 3:15; John 20:24-29
- Church Documents: Dei Filius; Fides et Ratio; YouCat ¬ß¬ß1-29

### SECTION A: Driving Questions

- "How do I know God is real if I can't see Him?"
- "What if my friends say faith is just made up?"
- "Why do we believe Catholic teachings and not others?"
- "Is it okay to have doubts sometimes?"

> At this age, children begin to think more abstractly and may encounter their first real intellectual challenges to faith. This year helps them see that faith is reasonable, that questions are welcome, and that Catholic belief can stand up to scrutiny.

### SECTION B: Doctrinal Content

#### Question: Whether we can prove God exists?

**Objection 1**: It seems we cannot prove God exists because proof requires evidence we can see or measure, and God is invisible.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, different religions disagree about God, so there must be no real proof.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, science explains everything without needing God, so belief is just for people who don't understand science.

**On the contrary**, St. Paul says "What can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them through what has been made"[1](#ref-1). Also, people throughout history‚Äîincluding great scientists‚Äîhave found compelling reasons to believe.

**I answer that** we can know God exists through reason, though we need faith to know Him personally. It's like knowing fire exists because you see smoke, even if you can't see the fire itself.

Here are five clues that point to God[2](#ref-2):

1. **Motion**: Everything that moves was moved by something else. Like dominoes falling‚Äîsomething had to push the first one. God is the "First Mover."

2. **Causation**: Everything has a cause. Your parents caused you, their parents caused them... but it can't go back forever. God is the "First Cause."

3. **Necessity**: Everything around us could exist or not exist (you might never have been born). But SOMETHING must necessarily exist, or nothing would exist. That's God.

4. **Perfection**: We recognize good, better, best. But how do we know what "best" is unless Perfect Goodness exists? That's God.

5. **Design**: Your eye is more complex than any camera. DNA contains more information than a library. Design needs a Designer. That's God.

**Reply to Objection 1**: We can't see gravity either, but we know it exists from its effects. Same with God‚Äîwe see His effects everywhere.

**Reply to Objection 2**: Different religions might disagree about God's details, but almost all agree He exists. It's like witnesses describing an accident differently‚Äîthey all saw something happen.

**Reply to Objection 3**: Science is wonderful at answering "how" but can't answer "why." Why is there something rather than nothing? Why are the laws of physics exactly right for life? Science points to God, not away from Him.

#### Faith and Reason: Friends, Not Enemies

**Question**: Whether faith goes against reason?

**Objection 1**: It seems faith is unreasonable because it asks us to believe things we can't prove scientifically.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, faith seems to be just wishful thinking‚Äîbelieving what makes us feel good.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, smart people should only believe what they can figure out themselves.

**On the contrary**, Jesus praised Peter's faith but also showed Thomas evidence[3](#ref-3). The Church has always taught that faith and reason work together[4](#ref-4).

**I answer that** faith and reason are like two wings that lift us to truth[5](#ref-5). Neither alone is enough:

- **Reason alone** is like trying to understand your parents' love using only math
- **Faith alone** is like trying to fly with one wing

Think of it this way:
- You **reason** that your parents exist (you see them)
- You have **faith** that they love you (love can't be proven mathematically)
- Both are real knowledge!

Faith is reasonable because:
1. It's based on evidence (miracles, changed lives, prophecies fulfilled)
2. It answers questions reason can't (Why do I exist? What happens after death?)
3. It's lived by brilliant people (scientists, doctors, philosophers who believe)
4. It makes life make sense (explains love, beauty, right and wrong)

**Reply to Objection 1**: We believe many things we can't prove scientifically‚Äîthat our parents love us, that Mozart is beautiful, that kindness is better than cruelty. Not all truth comes through test tubes.

**Reply to Objection 2**: Faith often asks us to believe hard things, not comfortable things. It's not wishful thinking‚Äîit's trust based on good reasons.

**Reply to Objection 3**: The smartest people know they can't figure out everything alone. We trust experts in other areas (doctors, pilots)‚Äîwhy not trust God who knows everything?

#### The Creed: What We Believe and Why

The Creed is like our family story‚Äîit tells us who we are. Let's explore why we believe each part:

**"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth"**

Why believe in God the Father?
- The universe had a beginning (Big Bang)‚Äîwhat caused it?[6](#ref-6)
- The universe follows laws‚Äîwho made the laws?
- We long for perfect love‚Äîwhere does that longing come from?

**"I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord"**

Why believe Jesus is God?
- He claimed to be God and backed it up with miracles[7](#ref-7)
- He rose from the dead‚Äîhundreds saw Him[8](#ref-8)
- He changed history more than any other person
- His teachings are too wise for a mere human

**"I believe in the Holy Spirit"**

Why believe in the Holy Spirit?
- Jesus promised to send Him[9](#ref-9)
- The Church's survival and growth despite persecution
- Changed lives (sinners becoming saints)
- Unity among believers across cultures and centuries

**"I believe in the holy Catholic Church"**

Why believe in the Church?
- Founded by Jesus on Peter[10](#ref-10)
- Unbroken line of popes for 2000 years
- Produces saints in every generation
- Guards the truth through good times and bad

### SECTION C: Thinking and Reflection Activities

#### üîç Critical Thinking Tasks

**Evidence Detective**
Make a chart with two columns:
1. Things I believe with proof (2+2=4, water freezes at 32¬∞F)
2. Things I believe without scientific proof (my friend likes me, courage is good)

What do you notice? Is all knowledge scientific?

**Reason Rally**
For each belief below, give a reason:
- Why do you believe your parents love you?
- Why do you believe stealing is wrong?
- Why do you believe in tomorrow?
- Why do you believe in God?

**Creed Connection**
Take one line of the Creed each week. Find:
1. A Bible verse that supports it
2. A saint who lived it
3. A reason it makes sense
4. A question you still have

#### üß† Metacognitive Prompts

**Doubt Diary**
It's okay to have questions! Write:
- "I wonder why..."
- "It's hard to believe that..."
- "I wish I understood..."
- "What helps me believe is..."

**Faith Thermometer**
Rate your faith today: Cold (lots of doubts), Cool (some questions), Warm (mostly believing), Hot (strong faith)
- What affects your "temperature"?
- Is it okay for it to change?

#### üìñ Scripture Meditation: Doubting Thomas

**Read**: John 20:24-29

**Picture It**: You're Thomas. Your friends say Jesus is alive, but you saw Him die. How do you feel? Now Jesus appears and invites you to touch His wounds...

**Think**:
- Was Thomas wrong to want evidence?
- Why did Jesus show him proof?
- What did Thomas say when he believed?
- What does Jesus say about us who believe without seeing?

**Talk to Jesus**: "Lord, when I doubt, help me..."

**Promise**: This week when you doubt, say Thomas's prayer: "My Lord and my God!"

### SECTION D: Integration With Life

#### üßçüèΩ Real-World Moral Scenario

**The Science Class Challenge**

Your teacher says: "Billions of years ago, everything came from nothing in the Big Bang, and life evolved by chance. That's science‚Äîanything else is just myths."

Your options:
1. Stay quiet and feel confused
2. Argue and say the teacher is wrong
3. Ask a respectful question
4. Talk to your parents/priest later

**The Faith-Reason Response**:
- Science tells us HOW (the Big Bang)
- Faith tells us WHO (God caused it) and WHY
- Many scientists believe in God (Georges Lema√Ætre, a priest, proposed the Big Bang theory!)
- You can believe both!

**Practice Saying**: "That's interesting! I learned that many scientists believe God could have used the Big Bang to create. What do you think?"

#### üì± Digital/Media Discernment

**"Fact-Checking" Faith**

Online, you'll see claims like:
- "Science disproves God"
- "Religion is for weak people"
- "Smart people are atheists"

**Critical Thinking Tools**:
1. **Check the source**: Who's saying this? Why?
2. **Look for evidence**: Do they prove their claim?
3. **Find the other side**: What do believers say?
4. **Test with reality**: Does this match what you know?

**Family Challenge**: Find one online claim against faith. Research together:
- Is it true?
- What's the Catholic response?
- How would you answer a friend who saw this?

#### üåè Interfaith & Pluralism

**Different Beliefs, Same Questions**

Everyone asks the big questions:
- **Atheists**: Believe matter is all there is
- **Muslims**: Believe in one God (Allah) but not Trinity
- **Hindus**: Believe in many forms of one divine reality
- **Buddhists**: Focus on ending suffering through enlightenment
- **Catholics**: Believe in Trinity, Incarnation, Church

**How to Dialogue**:
1. Find common ground: "We both think these questions matter"
2. Ask with curiosity: "What led you to believe that?"
3. Share without forcing: "In my faith, we believe..."
4. Respect differences: "That's interesting. I see it differently..."

> Remember: We believe we have the fullest truth in Catholic faith, but others have pieces of truth too. The Holy Spirit works everywhere![11](#ref-11)

#### üë£ Saint of the Week: St. Augustine

**The Great Seeker Who Found Truth**

Augustine was brilliant but lost. He tried everything:
- Partying (left him empty)
- False religions (didn't make sense)
- Philosophy (close but incomplete)

His mother Monica prayed for him for 17 years! Finally, he read Scripture and everything clicked. He became one of the Church's greatest thinkers, showing that:
- Faith completes reason
- Our hearts are restless until they rest in God[12](#ref-12)
- It's never too late to find truth

**This Week's Challenge**: Like Augustine, bring your real questions to God. Don't pretend to understand what you don't. Seek truth honestly!

### SECTION E: Parent Guide

#### üîç What This Year Is Really Forming

Your child is developing:
1. **Intellectual confidence**: Faith can withstand questions
2. **Critical thinking**: Not all claims are equal
3. **Catholic identity**: Why Catholic and not just Christian
4. **Rational faith**: Belief based on reasons, not just feelings
5. **Evangelical readiness**: Ability to explain belief to others

#### üß† Theology Behind the Simplicity

**The Act of Faith**
Faith involves three elements[13](#ref-13):
1. **Credere Deum** (Believe God exists)‚Äîintellectual assent
2. **Credere Deo** (Believe God)‚Äîtrust His revelation
3. **Credere in Deum** (Believe into God)‚Äîpersonal commitment

**Natural vs. Supernatural Revelation**
- **Natural**: What reason can know (God exists, basic morality)[14](#ref-14)
- **Supernatural**: What only God can reveal (Trinity, Incarnation)[15](#ref-15)
- Both are needed for full truth

**Development of Doctrine**
The Creed developed over time[16](#ref-16):
- Apostles' Creed (early summary)
- Nicene Creed (325 AD, clarifying Christ's divinity)
- Not new truths but deeper understanding
- Like a tree growing from seed

**Motives of Credibility**
The Church offers rational grounds for faith[17](#ref-17):
- Miracles (especially Resurrection)
- Prophecies fulfilled
- Church's miraculous spread
- Saints' heroic lives
- Teaching's coherence and beauty

#### üõ† How to Respond When...

**"My friend says only stupid people believe in God"**
"That's interesting, because some of the smartest people in history believed in God! Like Georges Lema√Ætre (Big Bang theory), Gregor Mendel (genetics), Blaise Pascal (probability), and thousands of others. Maybe your friend hasn't met smart believers yet. Faith isn't about being smart or stupid‚Äîit's about being humble enough to admit we can't figure out everything on our own. Even Einstein said, 'The more I study science, the more I believe in God.'"

**"How do we know our religion is the right one?"**
"Great question! We believe the Catholic Church has the fullest truth because: 1) Jesus founded it directly on Peter, 2) It's been around for 2000 years despite every attack, 3) It produced the most saints and schools and hospitals, 4) Its teachings make the most complete sense of reality. Other religions have some truth‚Äîlike having some pieces of a puzzle. We believe the Catholic Church has the complete picture. But we still respect others who are honestly seeking God!"

**"Why does the Creed say 'I believe' if we say it together?"**
"Beautiful observation! Each person must choose faith personally‚Äîno one can believe for you. When we say 'I believe' together, it's like a family where each person says 'I love you' to Mom. It's personal AND communal. The faith is mine, but I don't believe alone‚ÄîI believe with the whole Church throughout history!"

**"If God is good, why do bad things happen?"**
"This is maybe the hardest question humans ask! Here's part of the answer: God made us free because love must be free. Freedom means we can choose bad things, and those choices hurt others. Also, nature is broken because of sin‚Äîlike a computer virus affecting the whole system. But God brings good even from bad: Jesus' worst suffering became our salvation. We don't understand everything, but we trust God is working to fix it all. Meanwhile, we're His helpers in fighting evil with good!"

#### üõë What Not To Say

‚ùå "Doubts mean you're losing faith"
‚úÖ Say: "Doubts can help faith grow stronger when we work through them"

‚ùå "Because the Church says so"
‚úÖ Say: "The Church teaches this because..." (give reasons)
