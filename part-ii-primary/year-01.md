## Year 1: Who Made Me, and Why?

**Age Range**: 6‚Äì7 years (school Year 1)  
**Core Themes**: Creation, love, belonging, Trinity (name only), basic moral trust  
**Primary Sources**:
- Catechism of the Catholic Church: ¬ß¬ß1‚Äì3, 27‚Äì43, 355‚Äì373
- Bible: Genesis 1:1‚Äì31; Psalm 139:13‚Äì16; John 1:1‚Äì3
- Church Documents: Dei Verbum ¬ß2‚Äì3; Lumen Gentium ¬ß2; YouCat for Kids ¬ß1‚Äì5

### SECTION A: Driving Questions

- "Who made me?"
- "Why did God create everything?"
- "Does God see me and love me right now?"

> Children are already asking questions of identity‚Äîquietly. This module helps them ask aloud with sacred guidance. When a child asks, "Why am I here?", they're not looking for data‚Äîthey're looking for meaning. This unit begins with belonging, not with behavioral control.

### SECTION B: Doctrinal Content

#### Question: Whether God made me for a reason?

**Objection 1**: It seems God did not make me for a reason, because I can't see God or hear Him talking to me like I hear my parents.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, if God made me for a reason, why didn't He tell me what it is? My teacher tells me what my homework is!

**Objection 3**: Moreover, my friend said we came from monkeys, not from God.

**On the contrary**, the Bible says God knew us before we were born: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you"[¬π](#ref-1).

**I answer that** God made you on purpose, for a purpose! Think about when you draw a picture. You don't just scribble randomly‚Äîyou have an idea: "I want to draw my family" or "I want to make a rainbow." God is like the greatest artist ever, and when He made you, He had a wonderful idea: a person who could know Him, love Him, and be happy with Him forever[¬≤](#ref-2).

Imagine if you made a toy that could actually love you back. That would be amazing! That's what God did when He made people. He didn't need us‚ÄîHe was perfectly happy already. But He wanted to share His happiness, like when you're so happy you want to tell everyone and share your joy.

**Reply to Objection 1**: You can't see God with your eyes because He doesn't have a body like we do. But you can see what He does‚Äîlike how you can't see the wind, but you can see leaves dancing. You can't see love, but you feel it when Mom hugs you. God shows Himself through beautiful things, through people who love us, and especially through Jesus.

**Reply to Objection 2**: God does tell you! He tells you in the Bible, through the Church, through your parents, and in your heart. The basic reason is always the same: to know Him, love Him, and serve Him in this world, and be happy with Him forever in heaven[¬≥](#ref-3). The specific way you'll do this‚Äîas a teacher, parent, priest, doctor, or something else‚Äîyou'll discover as you grow.

**Reply to Objection 3**: Your friend is talking about something scientists study called evolution. That's about how bodies developed over a very long time. But even if God used a long process to make human bodies, He still specially creates each person's soul‚Äîthe part of you that thinks and loves and chooses. You're not just a fancy animal; you're made in God's image[‚Å¥](#ref-4)!

#### The Trinity (Introduction of Names)

We make the Sign of the Cross: "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

> This is like God's family name. Just like the Johnson family might have Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, and little Sally Johnson, but they're one family, God is three Persons but one God. At this age, that's enough to know. It's a mystery even grown-ups can't fully understand!

God the Father is like the best daddy ever‚ÄîHe made everything and takes care of us.
God the Son is Jesus‚ÄîHe came to earth to show us what God is like and to save us.
God the Holy Spirit is God living in our hearts, helping us be good and pray.

They're not three Gods‚Äîthat would be like having three suns in the sky! They're one God who loves in three ways.

#### God Knows and Loves Me

God is not like a clockmaker who makes a clock and walks away. He's more like a mother bird who watches over her nest constantly. The Bible tells us:

"You formed my inmost being; you knit me in my mother's womb"[‚Åµ](#ref-5)

Think about someone knitting a sweater. They choose every color, make every stitch carefully, and think about the person who will wear it. That's how carefully God made you! He thought about:
- What color your eyes would be
- What would make you laugh
- What special talents to give you
- Who your family would be
- Everything about you!

And He didn't just make you and forget. Right now, this very second, God:
- Sees you reading this
- Knows what you're thinking
- Loves you more than all the parents in the world love their children combined
- Has plans for your life that are good[‚Å∂](#ref-6)

### SECTION C: Thinking and Reflection Activities

#### üîç Critical Thinking Tasks

**Creation Detective**
Look around your room. For each thing you see, ask:
- Did people make this or did God make it?
- If people made it, what did they use? (Trace it back to God!)
- Example: Toy ‚Üí plastic ‚Üí oil ‚Üí ancient plants ‚Üí God!

**Drawing Challenge**
1. Draw yourself in the middle of a paper
2. Around you, draw things God made (sun, trees, animals, stars)
3. Draw a big heart above everything
4. Inside the heart, write "GOD LOVES ME"

#### üß† Metacognitive Prompts

**Thinking About Thinking**
- "When I feel happy, is that God smiling at me?"
- "What makes me different from my pet? What can I do that my pet can't?"
- "When do I feel closest to God? Why do you think that is?"

**Feeling Tracker**
Each night this week, put a sticker on a chart:
- üòä When I felt God's love today
- ü§î When I wondered about God
- üôè When I talked to God

#### üìñ Scripture Meditation (Lectio-style for children)

**Read**: Genesis 1:26-27
"Then God said, 'Let us make human beings in our image, in our likeness'... So God created human beings in his own image."

**Picture It**: Close your eyes. Imagine God as a great artist, painting or sculpting. He's making... you! What expression is on His face? (Joy? Concentration? Love?)

**Think**: What does it mean to be made "in God's image"? We don't look like God on the outside (He doesn't have a body!), so it must be on the inside. What do you have inside that's like God?

**Talk to God**: "God, thank you for making me like you in some way. Help me understand what that means."

**Promise**: "This week, I'll try to remember I'm made in God's image when I..." (feel sad, am mean to my sister, don't want to pray, etc.)

### SECTION D: Integration With Life

#### üßçüèΩ Real-World Moral Scenario

**The Broken Toy Dilemma**

Your little brother broke your favorite toy. You feel SO angry! You want to:
1. Break his toy too
2. Tell Mom and get him in trouble
3. Yell at him
4. Never let him play with your things again

**Let's Think**: If you're made in God's image, and God is love[‚Å∑](#ref-7), what would show God's image in you?

**What Would God Do?**
- Does God break our things when we mess up? (No!)
- Does God stop loving us when we do wrong? (Never!)
- Does God help us fix our mistakes? (Yes!)

**New Choice**: Maybe you could:
- Take a deep breath and pray for help
- Tell your brother you're sad but you forgive him
- Ask Mom to help fix it together
- Remember times you broke things and were forgiven

> When we choose love instead of revenge, we're showing we're made in God's image!

#### üì± Digital/Media Discernment

**Screen Time Check**
This week, when you watch shows or play games, ask:
- Does this show people being kind or mean?
- Does it make me feel peaceful or crazy?
- Would I want God to watch this with me?

**Good Screen/Bad Screen Chart**
Make two columns. Draw or write:
- Shows/games that help me think about good things
- Shows/games that make me think about not-good things

**Family Challenge**: Pick one show to watch together. Pause it three times to ask: "Is this showing God's love or not?"

#### üåè Interfaith & Pluralism

**God Made Everyone**

In your class, not everyone believes in God the same way. Some friends might:
- Pray differently (Muslims pray on a mat five times a day)
- Have different holy books (Jewish friends have the Torah)
- Not pray at all (some families don't know about God yet)

**Important Truth**: God made ALL people in His image, even if they don't know it yet![‚Å∏](#ref-8)

**Practice Saying**:
- "In my family, we believe..."
- "That's interesting! We do it differently..."
- "God loves you too!"

**Never Say**:
- "You're wrong!"
- "You're going to hell!"
- "My religion is better!"

> Jesus was friends with all kinds of people. He ate with tax collectors, talked with Samaritans, and helped Romans. We can be friends with everyone while still knowing what we believe.

#### üë£ Saint for the Week: St. Francis of Assisi

**The Man Who Saw God Everywhere**

Francis was a rich young man who loved parties and nice clothes. But one day, he heard God calling him to live differently. He gave away all his money and spent his time:
- Talking to birds about God
- Helping sick people no one else would touch
- Fixing broken churches with his bare hands
- Singing songs about how beautiful God's world is

**Francis's Secret**: He saw God's fingerprints on everything! He called the sun "Brother Sun" and the moon "Sister Moon." He even called death "Sister Death" because he wasn't afraid‚Äîhe knew he was going home to God.

**This Week's Challenge**: Be like Francis! Find three things in nature and give them family names (Brother Tree, Sister Flower). Thank God for making them.

**Francis's Prayer** (simplified):
"Lord, make me a helper:
Where people are sad, let me bring smiles.
Where people are fighting, let me make peace.
Where people are mean, let me show love."

### SECTION E: Parent Guide

#### üîç What This Year Is Really Forming

Beyond memorizing facts, you're helping your child develop:

1. **Existential Security**: I exist on purpose, for a purpose
2. **Theological Imagination**: God is real, present, and involved
3. **Moral Foundation**: I'm made for love, not selfishness
4. **Catholic Identity**: I belong to God's family
5. **Wonder Capacity**: The world is meaningful, not random

> You're not trying to explain the mystery of existence‚Äîyou're helping your child feel at home in it.

#### üß† Theology Behind the Simplicity

**"Made in God's Image" (Imago Dei)**
This doesn't mean physical resemblance but spiritual capacities[‚Åπ](#ref-9):
- **Intellect**: We can know truth (animals can't ponder meaning)
- **Will**: We can choose good (animals act on instinct)
- **Love**: We can give ourselves freely (animals mate and protect, but don't sacrifice for strangers)
- **Creativity**: We sub-create (animals build nests; we build cathedrals)
- **Communion**: We're made for relationship with God and others

**The Trinity Introduction**
At this age, we're not teaching theological precision but establishing:
- God is communion, not solitude
- Unity doesn't mean uniformity
- Love is the essence of God's inner life
- We're invited into this communion

**Creation vs. Making**
Helping children distinguish:
- God creates from nothing (ex nihilo)[¬π‚Å∞](#ref-10)
- We make from what exists
- God sustains everything in being moment by moment[¬π¬π](#ref-11)
- Without God, things wouldn't just stop working‚Äîthey'd stop existing

#### üõ† How to Respond When...

**"Why did God make mosquitoes/cancer/bad things?"**
"That's a question even grown-ups wonder about! We know God made everything good at first[¬π¬≤](#ref-12). But when sin came into the world, it messed things up‚Äîlike when you drop your iPad and the screen cracks. The iPad was good, but now it's broken. God lets broken things exist for now, but He promises to fix everything in the end[¬π¬≥](#ref-13). Meanwhile, He brings good even out of bad things‚Äîlike how you learned to be careful with electronics!"

**"My teacher said we came from monkeys"**
"Your teacher is talking about how bodies developed over time, which is interesting! Scientists study HOW things happened, like detectives. But they can't tell us WHY things exist‚Äîthat's what faith tells us. The Catholic Church says it's okay to believe God used evolution to make our bodies, as long as we know He specially creates each person's soul[¬π‚Å¥](#ref-14). You're not just a smart animal‚Äîyou have a soul that will live forever!"

**"I prayed but God didn't answer"**
"God always hears and always answers, but sometimes His answer is 'wait' or 'I have something better in mind.' It's like when you ask for candy for dinner‚ÄîI say no because I love you and know what's good for you. God can see everything‚Äîpast, present, and future‚Äîso He knows what we really need. Keep praying and watch for His answer. Sometimes it comes in surprising ways!"

**"Am I bad because I do bad things sometimes?"**
"No! You're good because God made you good. But sometimes you choose to do not-good things‚Äîwe all do. It's like being a prince or princess who sometimes forgets and acts like a regular kid. The bad things you do aren't who you ARE; they're mistakes you make. And the wonderful thing is God always forgives us when we're sorry and helps us do better next time[¬π‚Åµ](#ref-15)."

#### üõë What Not To Say

‚ùå "God will be sad/angry if you're bad"
‚úÖ Say: "When we choose to be unloving, we're not being who God made us to be"

‚ùå "God made you because He was lonely"
‚úÖ Say: "God was perfectly happy, but He wanted to share His happiness with you"

‚ùå "If you can't see God, He's not real"
‚úÖ Say: "The most real things‚Äîlove, beauty, goodness‚Äîare invisible"

‚ùå "Other religions are bad/wrong"
‚úÖ Say: "We believe we have the fullest truth, but other religions have some truth too"[¬π‚Å∂](#ref-16)

‚ùå "You have to be good for God to love you"
‚úÖ Say: "God loves you always. Being good is how we love Him back"
