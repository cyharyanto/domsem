## Year 2: Who is Jesus?

**Age Range**: 7-8 years (school Year 2)  
**Core Themes**: Incarnation, Jesus' life and teachings, Paschal mystery, Jesus as friend and Savior  
**Primary Sources**:
- Catechism of the Catholic Church: ¬ß¬ß422-682
- Bible: The Four Gospels, especially Luke and Mark
- Church Documents: Dei Verbum ¬ß¬ß17-20; YouCat for Kids ¬ß¬ß6-30

### SECTION A: Driving Questions

- "Why did Jesus come to earth?"
- "Is Jesus really God, or just a very good person?"  
- "Why did Jesus have to die?"
- "What does Jesus do now?"

> At this age, children can move beyond "baby Jesus" to encounter Christ as teacher, healer, friend, and savior. They're ready to grapple with the paradox of the God-man and begin understanding salvation not just as a concept but as a love story.

### SECTION B: Doctrinal Content

#### Question: Whether Jesus is truly God and truly man?

**Objection 1**: It seems Jesus cannot be God, because God is everywhere and knows everything, but Jesus was in one place and had to learn things like how to walk and talk.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, God cannot die, but Jesus died on the cross. So Jesus must be just a holy man, not God.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, Jesus prayed to God the Father. How can God pray to God? That doesn't make sense.

**On the contrary**, Jesus Himself said, "I and the Father are one"[1](#ref-1), and St. Thomas called Him "My Lord and my God!"[2](#ref-2)

**I answer that** Jesus is the most amazing person who ever lived because He is both fully God and fully human. This is like having a dual citizenship‚Äîsome people are fully American AND fully Mexican. They're not half and half; they're completely both!

Here's a way to think about it: Imagine if the person who invented Minecraft could actually enter the game as a character. They would know all the secret codes and have all the power of the creator, but they would also experience the game world like any player‚Äîgetting hungry, needing shelter, even "dying" and respawning. That's a tiny bit like what God did in Jesus‚Äîthe Creator entered His creation!

Jesus has two natures in one person[3](#ref-3):
- **Divine nature**: He can forgive sins, calm storms, know people's thoughts, rise from the dead
- **Human nature**: He was born, grew up, got hungry, felt sad, had friends, died

**Reply to Objection 1**: Jesus chose to experience human limitations. It's like a dad crawling on the floor to play with his baby‚Äîhe doesn't lose his ability to walk; he chooses to meet the baby where they are. Jesus "emptied himself"[4](#ref-4) to be with us.

**Reply to Objection 2**: Jesus died in His human nature, but His divine nature cannot die. It's like when you go to sleep‚Äîyour body rests, but your soul keeps existing. When Jesus died, His human body died, but He was still God, which is why He could rise again!

**Reply to Objection 3**: Jesus shows us that God is Trinity‚ÄîFather, Son, and Holy Spirit in perfect love. The Son talking to the Father isn't confusion; it's relationship! It's like in a really close family where everyone talks to each other all the time.

#### Why Did Jesus Come? The Great Rescue Mission

**Question**: Whether God became man out of necessity or love?

**Objection 1**: It seems God had to become man to fix the mess of sin, like a repairman has to come when the sink breaks.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, only God could pay the debt of sin, so He had no choice but to come Himself.

**On the contrary**, "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son"[5](#ref-5)‚Äîlove, not necessity, motivated the Incarnation.

**I answer that** God didn't come because He had to, but because He wanted to. Imagine your friend falls into a deep pit. You could throw down a rope, or hire someone to help, but instead you climb down yourself to be with them and help them climb out. That's even better than rescue‚Äîit's friendship!

God became man for five amazing reasons[6](#ref-6):
1. **To save us from sin**: Like a lifeguard diving into dangerous waters
2. **To show us God's love**: Words weren't enough; He had to demonstrate
3. **To be our model**: To show us how to live as God's children
4. **To make us "sharers in divinity"**: To lift us up to share God's life
5. **To defeat death**: To transform our greatest fear into a doorway home

> Think of it this way: Sin had created a Grand Canyon between us and God. We couldn't jump across. So God built a bridge‚Äîand the bridge is Jesus! But even more, Jesus doesn't just help us cross; He carries us!

#### The Life of Jesus: God's Love Made Visible

**The Hidden Years (Birth to 30)**

Jesus spent 30 years in ordinary life! He:
- Learned to walk and talk like you did
- Helped Mary with chores
- Learned carpentry from Joseph
- Played with other children
- Studied Scripture at synagogue
- Prayed daily with His family

> Why so long in hiddenness? Jesus shows us that ordinary life is holy too. You don't have to do big things to please God‚Äîdoing small things with love is enough![7](#ref-7)

**The Public Ministry (Age 30-33)**

For three years, Jesus traveled around showing people what God is really like:

**Through His Teaching**:
- Parables: Stories that hide deep truth (like treasure in a field!)
- Beatitudes: The "Be-Attitudes"‚Äîhow to be truly happy
- Lord's Prayer: Teaching us to call God "Daddy" (Abba)

**Through His Miracles**:
Each miracle was a sign pointing to something bigger:
- Healing blind ‚Üí "I am the light of the world"[8](#ref-8)
- Feeding 5000 ‚Üí "I am the bread of life"[9](#ref-9)
- Raising the dead ‚Üí "I am the resurrection"[10](#ref-10)

**Through His Friendships**:
- Chose 12 ordinary men as apostles
- Was friends with "sinners" and outcasts
- Let children come to Him[11](#ref-11)
- Had close friends like Mary, Martha, and Lazarus

#### The Paschal Mystery: The Greatest Love Story

**Question**: Whether Jesus had to suffer and die?

**Objection 1**: It seems cruel that God would require suffering. Couldn't He just forgive without the cross?

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, if Jesus is all-powerful, He could have saved us with a single word.

**On the contrary**, Jesus said, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends"[12](#ref-12).

**I answer that** Jesus didn't die because God is mean or needed blood. He died because that's how much He loves us! 

Imagine you broke your mom's most precious vase‚Äîthe one her grandma gave her. You feel terrible. Mom forgives you right away, but she sees you still feel bad. So she does something amazing: she carefully glues every piece back together, cuts her finger in the process, and makes the vase even more beautiful than before. Her small suffering shows you how much she loves you AND fixes what was broken.

That's a tiny picture of what Jesus did, but much bigger:
- We broke our friendship with God (sin)
- Jesus forgave us AND fixed what was broken
- His suffering shows us how serious sin is AND how powerful love is
- His resurrection shows that love is stronger than death!

### SECTION C: Thinking and Reflection Activities

#### üîç Critical Thinking Tasks

**Jesus Detective Work**
Read one short Gospel story each day this week. After each story, investigate:
1. What did Jesus DO? (action)
2. What did Jesus SAY? (teaching)  
3. What does this show about WHO JESUS IS? (identity)

**Compare and Contrast**
Make two columns:
- Things Jesus did that only God can do
- Things Jesus did that show He's human
What do you notice? (He's both!)

**Miracle Mapper**
On a simple map of Israel:
- Put a ‚≠ê where Jesus was born (Bethlehem)
- Put a üè† where He grew up (Nazareth)
- Put ‚ù§Ô∏è where He did miracles
- Put ‚úùÔ∏è where He died and rose (Jerusalem)

#### üß† Metacognitive Prompts

**Thinking About Jesus**
- "When I picture Jesus, what does He look like? Why do I imagine Him that way?"
- "What's the hardest thing to understand about Jesus?"
- "If I could ask Jesus one question, what would it be?"

**Feeling Tracker**
- üòä When do I feel closest to Jesus?
- üòî When do I forget about Jesus?
- ü§î What about Jesus confuses me?
- ‚ù§Ô∏è What about Jesus makes me happy?

#### üìñ Scripture Meditation: The Good Shepherd

**Read**: John 10:11-15
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."

**Picture It**: You're a little sheep in a big field. It's getting dark. You hear wolves howling. Then you see the shepherd‚Äîit's Jesus! How does He look at you? What does He do?

**Think**: 
- Why does Jesus call Himself a shepherd instead of a king?
- What's the difference between a "hired hand" and a good shepherd?
- Am I a difficult sheep or an easy sheep to take care of?

**Talk to Jesus**: "Jesus, my Good Shepherd, thank you for..." (Let the child finish)

**Do**: This week, when you feel scared or alone, remember: "Jesus is my shepherd. He's watching over me."

### SECTION D: Integration With Life

#### üßçüèΩ Real-World Moral Scenario

**The Playground Test**

There's a new kid at school who doesn't speak English well. At recess, some kids are laughing at how he talks. You have three choices:
1. Join in so you fit in with the popular kids
2. Walk away and play somewhere else
3. Go talk to the new kid and invite him to play

**Think Like Jesus**:
- What did Jesus do when people were left out?
- Remember when Jesus was new in Egypt as a baby?[13](#ref-13)
- How did Jesus treat people who were "different"?

**The Jesus Choice**: Jesus always chose the lonely person. He ate with tax collectors, touched lepers, talked to Samaritans. Following Jesus means sometimes being unpopular to be loving.

**Practice Saying**: "Hey, want to play with us?" in a friendly voice. Practice at home so it's easier at school!

#### üì± Digital/Media Discernment

**Jesus in the Media**

This week, pay attention:
- How do TV shows/games show heroes?
- Do they solve problems with violence or wisdom?
- Do they care about weak people or just strong ones?

**The Jesus Test for Media**:
1. Does the hero forgive enemies or just defeat them?
2. Does power = good, or does love = good?
3. Are "losers" mocked or valued?

**Family Challenge**: Find a movie/show hero who acts like Jesus in some way. How? Find one who doesn't. What's different?

#### üåè Interfaith & Pluralism

**What Others Believe About Jesus**

Different people believe different things about Jesus:
- **Jews**: A teacher, but not the Messiah yet
- **Muslims**: A great prophet, but not God's Son
- **Hindus**: An enlightened teacher like their gurus
- **Atheists**: Maybe just a story or a good man

**What We Believe**: Jesus is fully God and fully man, our Savior and Lord[14](#ref-14).

**How to Talk About It**:
- "I believe Jesus is God's Son who saves us"
- "What do you believe about Jesus?"
- "That's interesting. Can you tell me more?"
- Never: "You're wrong!" or "You're going to hell!"

> Remember: Jesus didn't force anyone to believe. He invited, He loved, He showed. We do the same.

#### üë£ Saint of the Week: St. Juan Diego

**The Man Who Saw Mary**

Juan Diego was a poor Native Mexican man. In 1531, when he was walking to Mass, a beautiful lady appeared to him‚Äîit was Mary, Jesus' mother! She asked him to tell the bishop to build a church. 

The bishop didn't believe Juan Diego at first. (Would you believe someone who said they saw Mary?) So Mary gave Juan Diego a sign: roses in winter and her image miraculously printed on his cloak!

**Why This Matters**: 
- God chooses ordinary people for important jobs
- Jesus' mother still cares about us
- God speaks every language and loves every culture

**This Week's Challenge**: Like Juan Diego, be brave when you have something important to say about God, even if people might not believe you at first.

### SECTION E: Parent Guide

#### üîç What This Year Is Really Forming

Your child is developing:
1. **Christological Identity**: Jesus as personal friend and cosmic Lord
2. **Incarnational Worldview**: God enters our mess, doesn't avoid it
3. **Paschal Spirituality**: Suffering has meaning; death isn't the end
4. **Missionary Consciousness**: If Jesus is good news, I should share Him
5. **Scriptural Imagination**: The Gospels as living story, not ancient text

#### üß† Theology Behind the Simplicity

**The Hypostatic Union**
What we're really teaching when we say "God and man":
- One Divine Person (the Word) with two natures[15](#ref-15)
- Not a human person whom God adopted
- Not God pretending to be human
- Not half-God, half-man
- But fully both, united in the Person of Christ

**Cur Deus Homo? (Why Did God Become Man?)**
The tradition gives multiple complementary reasons[16](#ref-16):
- **Satisfaction Theory** (Anselm): To repair infinite offense
- **Ransom Theory**: To free us from slavery
- **Moral Influence**: To show us how to live
- **Divinization**: To make us "partakers of divine nature"[17](#ref-17)
- **Cosmic Recapitulation**: To sum up all creation in Himself

**The Paschal Mystery**
Not just death, but the whole movement[18](#ref-18):
- Passion (suffering)
- Death (separation)
- Descent (solidarity with the dead)
- Resurrection (victory)
- Ascension (humanity in heaven)

This is the pattern of all Christian life: dying to self, rising in Christ.

#### üõ† How to Respond When...

**"Why didn't Jesus just zap the bad people?"**
"Great question! Jesus could have used His power that way, but He came to save people, not destroy them. Remember, we're all 'bad people' sometimes. If Jesus zapped everyone who sinned, there'd be no one left! Instead, He chose to change hearts with love. It's like the difference between forcing someone to be your friend and winning their friendship‚Äîwhich is better?"

**"Did it hurt Jesus to die since He's God?"**
"Yes, it hurt terribly. Being God didn't make Jesus immune to pain‚Äîit made Him experience it perfectly. When you stub your toe, it hurts but you might forget about it. Jesus felt every bit of suffering completely. That's what makes His love so amazing‚ÄîHe knew exactly how much it would hurt and chose it anyway because He loves us that much."

**"If Jesus rose from the dead, where is He now?"**
"Jesus is in heaven with His Father, but here's the amazing part‚ÄîHe's also with us! After He rose, Jesus promised 'I am with you always'[19](#ref-19). He's with us in a special way in the Eucharist, He lives in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, and He's present when we gather in His name[20](#ref-20). So He's both in heaven AND here‚Äîbecause God isn't limited by space like we are!"

**"My friend says Jesus was just a good teacher"**
"Your friend is right that Jesus was a good teacher‚Äîmaybe the best ever! But good teachers don't usually claim to forgive sins, calm storms, or rise from the dead. C.S. Lewis said Jesus is either a liar (He knew He wasn't God but said He was), a lunatic (He thought He was God but wasn't), or Lord (He really is God)[21](#ref-21). What we believe is based on His miracles, His resurrection, and the way He changed the world."

#### üõë What Not To Say

‚ùå "Jesus died because God was angry"
‚úÖ Say: "Jesus died to show us how much God loves us"

‚ùå "Jesus isn't human anymore"
‚úÖ Say: "Jesus is still human in heaven‚ÄîHe kept His body to be close to us forever"

‚ùå "If you're good, you're like Jesus"
‚úÖ Say: "Jesus helps us be good‚Äîwe can't do it without Him"

‚ùå "Jesus was European/white"
‚úÖ Say: "Jesus was Middle Eastern, but He came for all people"

‚ùå "Jews killed Jesus"
‚úÖ Say: "Our sins killed Jesus‚ÄîHe died for everyone"[22](#ref-22)

#### üôèüèΩ Liturgical Practices

**Daily**
- Morning: "Jesus, I give you my day"
- Before meals: "Thank you, Jesus, for being the Bread of Life"
- Difficulties: "Jesus, you understand because you were human too"
