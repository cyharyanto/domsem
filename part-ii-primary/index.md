# Part II — Primary Years (Years 1-6): Building the Grammar of Catholic Life

## Overview

The primary years build upon the sacramental foundation established in the pre-school period. Children now begin to understand the "why" behind the "what" of Catholic life, developing:

- **Doctrinal knowledge**: Understanding of core Catholic teachings
- **Moral reasoning**: Beginning to grasp right and wrong
- **Liturgical participation**: Active engagement in Mass and sacraments
- **Apologetic foundations**: Basic answers to common questions

## Key Principles

1. **Question-driven learning**: Each year centers on a fundamental question
2. **Systematic approach**: Building knowledge in a logical progression
3. **Age-appropriate depth**: Respecting cognitive development while challenging growth
4. **Integration with life**: Connecting faith to daily experiences and challenges

## Developmental Focus

- **Year 1**: Understanding creation, purpose, and human dignity
- **Year 2**: Encountering Jesus as both God and man
- **Year 3**: Understanding sacraments as channels of grace
- **Year 4**: Developing reasons for belief and trust
- **Year 5**: Understanding the Church as Christ's body
- **Year 6**: Deepening participation in the Eucharist

## Teaching Methods

- **Scholastic approach**: Using questions, objections, and reasoned answers
- **Narrative theology**: Learning through stories and examples
- **Active participation**: Hands-on activities and projects
- **Family integration**: Connecting school learning with home life
