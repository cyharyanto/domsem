## Year 11: What Is Justice?

**Age Range**: 16-17 years (school Year 11)
**Core Themes**: Catholic Social Teaching (CST), justice vs. charity, common good, subsidiarity, solidarity, preferential option for the poor.
**Primary Sources**:
-   Catechism of the Catholic Church: ¬ß¬ß1928-1948 (Social Justice), 2419-2463 (Economic Life, Justice)
-   Bible: Amos 5:24; Micah 6:8; Matthew 25:31-46; Luke 4:18-19; James 2:14-17
-   Church Documents: *Rerum Novarum* (Leo XIII), *Centesimus Annus* (John Paul II), *Caritas in Veritate* (Benedict XVI), *Laudato Si'* (Francis)

### SECTION A: Driving Questions

-   "The world talks a lot about 'social justice.' Is that the same as what the Church teaches?"
-   "Am I responsible for poverty and injustice on the other side of the world?"
-   "How can I be a faithful Catholic in a politically polarized world without just becoming a partisan for one side?"
-   "Is it enough to be personally kind and charitable, or does God demand that I work to change unjust systems?"

> High school students are idealistic and acutely aware of global injustice. This year channels that passion, moving beyond simplistic political labels to the deep, coherent, and challenging vision of Catholic Social Teaching. The goal is to form disciples who can analyze social problems with the mind of the Church and act with the heart of Christ.

### SECTION B: Doctrinal Content

#### Question: Whether justice is primarily about equality of outcomes?

**Objection 1**: It seems so, for vast inequalities in wealth and power are a source of great suffering. A just society would ensure everyone has roughly the same resources.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, Scripture says "the laborer deserves his wages"[1](#ref-1), but some CEOs earn thousands of times more than their workers. This is inherently unequal and therefore unjust.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, historical injustices (like colonialism and slavery) have given some groups an unfair advantage. Justice requires leveling the playing field, even if it means redistributing wealth from the privileged to the disadvantaged.

**On the contrary**, the classical definition of justice, adopted by the Church, is "the constant and firm will to give their due to God and neighbor"[2](#ref-2). This focuses on what is *due*, not what is *equal*.

**I answer that** we must distinguish between different kinds of justice and between justice and envy. The Church's vision of justice is far more radical and comprehensive than mere economic equality.

-   **Commutative Justice**: Governs relationships between individuals (e.g., paying a fair price for a good).
-   **Distributive Justice**: Governs what the community owes the individual (e.g., ensuring everyone has access to basic necessities).
-   **Legal Justice**: Governs what the individual owes the community (e.g., paying taxes, obeying just laws).

The goal is not a flat equality, which can be profoundly unjust (e.g., giving the same grade to the student who studied and the one who did not). The goal is the **Common Good**: the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily[3](#ref-3). A society is just when it is ordered toward the flourishing of every single person, respecting their dignity and contribution. While this requires addressing gross inequalities, it does not aim for a bland and coercive sameness.

**Reply to Objection 1**: Envy, one of the seven deadly sins, can disguise itself as a call for justice. The Church's concern is not that some have more, but that some have *less than what is their due* as human beings made in God's image. The focus is on lifting the floor, not lowering the ceiling.

**Reply to Objection 2**: This may be an example of a violation of distributive or commutative justice. The question is not "are they unequal?" but "is the wage a just wage that allows the worker to live in dignity?" and "is the CEO's compensation proportional to their contribution to the common good?" The disparity itself is a symptom to be examined, not the injustice itself.

**Reply to Objection 3**: The Church strongly affirms the need for restorative justice to address historical wrongs. This is part of giving a people their due. However, this must be done according to prudence and justice, not as an act of revenge or class warfare, always aiming for reconciliation and the common good of all.

#### Question: Whether all social problems should be solved by the central government?

**Objection 1**: It seems so, for the government has the most resources and authority to address large-scale problems like poverty, healthcare, and education.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, relying on local or private initiatives is inefficient and leads to a patchwork of unequal services. A centralized approach ensures uniformity and fairness.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, Jesus commands us to care for the poor. The most effective way to do this on a large scale is through government welfare programs funded by taxes.

**On the contrary**, Pope Pius XI taught that "it is a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do"[4](#ref-4). This is the principle of **Subsidiarity**.

**I answer that** Catholic Social Teaching navigates between the errors of collectivism (which crushes the person) and radical individualism (which ignores the community). It does this through the twin principles of **Subsidiarity** and **Solidarity**.

-   **Subsidiarity**: Problems should be solved at the most local, immediate level possible. A higher-level body (like the state) should only step in when a lower-level body (like a family, neighborhood, or local charity) is unable to address the need. The state's role is to *help* (from *subsidium*, "help, aid") the lower bodies, not to absorb or replace them. This protects personal responsibility and local community.

-   **Solidarity**: We are all one human family, responsible for one another. We are our brothers' and sisters' keepers. This is not a vague feeling but a firm and persevering determination to commit oneself to the common good[5](#ref-5). This principle protects us from selfish indifference and calls us to be concerned with global poverty, injustice, and suffering.

Subsidiarity and Solidarity are not opposed but are two sides of the same coin. Solidarity without subsidiarity leads to an impersonal, bureaucratic welfare state. Subsidiarity without solidarity leads to a selfish, "not-in-my-backyard" individualism. A just society holds them in creative tension.

**Reply to Objection 1**: The government's role is indispensable, but it should not be the first resort. It should empower local communities, not replace them. For example, it is better to support a local church's food bank than to create a massive, impersonal federal food agency that replaces it.

**Reply to Objection 2**: Uniformity is not always the same as justice. Local solutions are often more creative, personal, and effective because they are tailored to specific needs. The goal is human flourishing, not bureaucratic efficiency.

**Reply to Objection 3**: We are all commanded to care for the poor. This is a personal and communal duty before it is a state duty. We cannot "outsource" our Christian duty of charity to the tax system. The state can and should provide a safety net, but it cannot replace the personal encounter and love that true Christian charity demands.

### SECTION C: Thinking and Reflection Activities

#### üîç Critical Thinking Tasks

**CST Case Study**
Choose a current social issue (e.g., homelessness in your city, fast fashion supply chains, climate change). Analyze it using the main principles of CST:
1.  **Dignity of the Human Person**: Whose dignity is being violated?
2.  **Common Good**: What would a solution that helps everyone flourish look like?
3.  **Solidarity**: What is my responsibility to those affected, even if they are far away?
4.  **Subsidiarity**: What is the most local, personal level at which this problem can be addressed? When is it necessary for the state or a larger body to intervene?
5.  **Preferential Option for the Poor**: How does this issue look from the perspective of the most vulnerable?

**Charity vs. Justice**
Create two columns. In one, list acts of **Charity** (meeting immediate needs). In the other, list acts of **Justice** (addressing the root causes of needs).
-   Example: Giving a homeless person a sandwich (Charity). Advocating for affordable housing policies (Justice).
-   Are both necessary? Why? Can you have one without the other?

#### üß† Metacognitive Prompts

**Consumption Conscience Examination**
- "When I buy a cheap t-shirt or a new phone, what chain of human relationships am I participating in? Do I know who made it or in what conditions?"
- "How does my use of social media contribute to polarization or solidarity?"
- "What voices do I listen to on issues of justice? Are they ideologically driven, or are they rooted in a concern for the common good and the dignity of all?"

#### üìñ Scripture Meditation: The Prophet Amos

**Read**: Amos 5:21-24
"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies... But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."

**Picture It**: God speaking these words through Amos to a nation that was very religious on the outside‚Äîthey went to the temple, offered sacrifices‚Äîbut ignored the poor and oppressed in their midst.

**Think**:
- What is God saying about the relationship between worship (liturgy) and justice?
- Can I be a good Catholic if I go to Mass every Sunday but don't care about the poor?
- What does the image of justice "rolling down like waters" feel like? What does it look like in my school or community?

### SECTION D: Integration With Life

#### üßçüèΩ Real-World Moral Scenario

Your school is holding a debate on climate change.
-   **Side A** argues for massive government regulation, carbon taxes, and a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, even if it causes economic disruption and job losses in some communities. "The planet's survival is at stake!"
-   **Side B** argues that these regulations will hurt the poor most, stifle economic development, and that the focus should be on technological innovation and personal responsibility. "We can't destroy people's livelihoods for a computer model's prediction!"

**Thinking with the Mind of the Church**:
A Catholic approach transcends this partisan binary. Using CST, you could argue:
-   From **Laudato Si'**: Yes, there is a crisis. We have a duty of stewardship for creation, our common home. The cry of the earth and the cry of the poor are one[6](#ref-6). (Solidarity)
-   From **Centesimus Annus**: The solution cannot be a top-down state-controlled system that ignores the human person and legitimate economic freedom[7](#ref-7). (Subsidiarity)
-   A Catholic position would seek an **integral ecology**: solutions that link environmental protection with authentic human development, with a preferential option for the poor, who are often most affected by both environmental degradation and poorly designed policies.

#### üì± Digital/Media Discernment

**The Outrage-Industrial Complex**
Social media algorithms profit from injustice, but not by solving it. They profit by showing you content that makes you angry. Outrage drives engagement.
-   **Observe**: Scroll your feed for 10 minutes. How many posts are designed to make you angry about an injustice? How many offer a concrete, charitable, and local path for action?
-   **Discern**: Is this post calling me to **Solidarity** (a commitment to the common good) or just to join a digital mob? Is it an act of **Justice**, or is it **Virtue Signaling** (publicly expressing opinions to show you're a good person)?
-   **Action**: Unfollow accounts that only peddle outrage. Follow organizations (like Catholic Relief Services, your local St. Vincent de Paul society) that are actually doing the work.

#### üåè Interfaith & Pluralism

**Visions of a Just Society**
-   **Judaism**: The concept of *Tikkun Olam* ("repairing the world") is a powerful driver for social action and justice.
-   **Islam**: *Zakat* (obligatory almsgiving) is one of the five pillars, institutionalizing care for the poor as central to the faith.
-   **Secular Marxism**: Justice is achieved through class struggle to overthrow oppressive structures and create a classless, stateless society. (Catholic critique: It is materialist, rejects human dignity beyond the collective, and often justifies evil means for its end.)

**Dialogue Point**: The Catholic vision is unique in its insistence on both personal conversion and social reform, and in its foundational principles of subsidiarity and solidarity, which protect against both state tyranny and selfish individualism.

#### üë£ Saint of the Week: Dorothy Day

**The Troublemaker for Christ**

Dorothy Day was a journalist and bohemian activist in New York in the 1920s. Before her conversion to Catholicism, she lived a wild life, even having an abortion. After her conversion, she didn't leave her passion for the poor and marginalized behind; she brought it into the heart of the Church.

With Peter Maurin, she founded the **Catholic Worker Movement**. They started:
-   **Houses of Hospitality**: Living with the poor, offering food and shelter, not as clients but as guests.
-   **A Newspaper**: The *Catholic Worker* sold for a penny a copy and challenged Catholics to take the Gospel's call to justice seriously.
-   **Farming Communes**: To live a life of simple labor and prayer.

She was a radical who was arrested multiple times for protests. Yet she went to Mass daily and prayed the Rosary. She showed that one could be completely orthodox, devoted to the Church, and at the same time a fierce critic of social injustice.

**Her Witness**: "The greatest challenge of the day is: how to bring about a revolution of the heart, a revolution which has to start with each one of us?"

### SECTION E: Parent Guide

#### üîç What This Year Is Really Forming

-   **A Catholic Political Imagination**: The ability to analyze social issues from a perspective that is not "left" or "right" but "Catholic."
-   **Economic Morality**: Understanding that economic choices are moral choices.
-   **Global Consciousness**: A sense of responsibility for the whole human family.
-   **Prudential Judgment**: The wisdom to apply timeless principles to complex, changing situations.
-   **Hopeful Realism**: A clear-eyed view of the world's problems combined with a deep trust in God's grace and the power of personal action.

#### üß† Theology Behind the Simplicity

-   **The Universal Destination of Goods**: The principle that the goods of creation are destined for the whole human race. Private property is a right, but it is not absolute; it carries a "social mortgage"[8](#ref-8).
-   **Integral Human Development**: Development is not just about economic growth. It must include the social, cultural, spiritual, and moral dimensions of the person.
-   **Structures of Sin**: John Paul II's term for social situations or institutions that are the fruit of personal sin and which in turn lead to more sin (e.g., a system of predatory lending). Justice requires working to dismantle these structures.
-   **Charity and Justice**: Pope Benedict XVI, in *Caritas in Veritate*, emphasized that justice is the primary way of charity. Loving your neighbor means first working to ensure they are given their due.

#### üõ† How to Respond When...

**"The Church is rich! Why doesn't it just sell all its art and give the money to the poor?"**
"That's a question many people ask. First, we have to remember what the Church 'is.' Most of the wealth is in local parishes, schools, and hospitals that are serving people directly. Second, the art and architecture are not the Pope's personal property; they are the heritage of all humanity, held in trust. They were created to give glory to God and to lift the human spirit‚Äîespecially the spirits of the poor, who historically had access to beauty in the cathedrals when their own lives were drab. Third, if the Vatican sold everything, it would be a one-time injection of cash that would quickly disappear. The Church's long-term mission is to build institutions that serve the poor for centuries. That said, the question comes from a good impulse, and it should always challenge the Church to live more simply and generously."

**"My friends all support [Political Party X]. If I don't, am I a bad Catholic/bad person?"**
"The Church is not a political party. A faithful Catholic can be a member of various political parties in good conscience, but no party perfectly reflects Catholic teaching. The Church gives us principles (Dignity, Common Good, etc.), but it doesn't give us a voting guide. Our job is to use those principles to evaluate all parties and candidates. You will likely find that you agree with Party X on some issues and Party Y on others. That's a sign you are thinking like a Catholic, not a partisan. Your identity is in Christ, not in a political tribe."

**"It's all overwhelming. I'm just one person. What can I possibly do about global poverty?"**
"The feeling of being overwhelmed is real. But Mother Teresa taught us, 'Never worry about numbers. Help one person at a time and always start with the person nearest you.' You are not called to solve global poverty by yourself. You are called to be faithful in your own life. Start small and local. Volunteer at the parish food pantry. Learn where your clothes come from. Treat the person right in front of you with justice and dignity. Change the world by changing your small corner of it. That is all God asks."

#### üôèüèΩ Liturgical Practices

-   **Mass Offertory**: When the gifts of bread and wine are brought forward, consciously offer a specific social injustice to God, asking Him to unite it with Christ's sacrifice.
-   **Fasting for Justice**: Once a month, fast from a meal and donate the money you would have spent to an organization that works for justice (like Catholic Relief Services or a local Catholic Worker house).
-   **A 'Just' Rosary**: When praying the Sorrowful Mysteries, meditate on how Christ's suffering is continued today in the oppressed, the poor, and the marginalized.
-   **Labor Day / St. Joseph the Worker (May 1)**: Use this day to reflect on the dignity of work. Pray for the unemployed, the underemployed, and those who work in exploitative conditions.

#### üìö Further Adult Reading

-   **Key Encyclicals**: *Rerum Novarum* (Leo XIII), *Quadragesimo Anno* (Pius XI), *Centesimus Annus* (John Paul II), *Caritas in Veritate* (Benedict XVI), *Laudato Si'* (Francis).
-   **Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church**: A comprehensive summary of CST published by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.
-   **Commentaries**: *A Shorter Summa* (Peter Kreeft - for the section on justice), *Doing the Truth in Charity* (Thomas Williams, LC).
-   **Contemporary Authors**: Works by George Weigel, R. R. Reno, and Arthur C. Brooks often engage with CST from different perspectives.

### SECTION F: Self-Reading Guide

#### üß© What to Look For

-   Find the four core principles of Catholic Social Teaching. Which one is most challenging or new to you?
-   Mark the distinction between charity and justice.
-   Underline the definition of the Common Good. How is it different from "the greatest good for the greatest number"?

#### üó£ Try Saying This

-   "Politics is the art of applying love and justice to our life in common."
-   "My faith is not 'personal'; it has social consequences."
-   "I am not a Democrat or a Republican first; I am a Catholic first."

How does saying these statements feel? Do they challenge your current assumptions?

#### üîÑ Think About This

-   Examine your own closet. Where were your clothes made? What do you know about the people who made them?
-   If Jesus looked at your bank account or your screen time, what would He say about your priorities regarding justice?
-   Who are the "poor" in your school or community? (Not just economically poor, but poor in friendship, hope, or dignity).

#### ‚úç My Reflection Box

"A specific injustice that breaks my heart is..."
