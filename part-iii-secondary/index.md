## Overview

The secondary years represent a crucial period of intellectual and spiritual maturation. Young people move from receiving faith to questioning, understanding, and ultimately choosing to embrace it as their own. This period focuses on:

- **Critical thinking**: Developing the ability to analyze and evaluate ideas
- **Apologetics**: Learning to defend and explain the faith
- **Moral formation**: Understanding virtue, conscience, and ethical reasoning
- **Vocational discernment**: Discovering one's unique call and mission

## Key Principles

1. **Intellectual rigor**: Engaging with complex questions and competing worldviews
2. **Personal ownership**: Moving from inherited faith to chosen faith
3. **Cultural engagement**: Learning to navigate secular environments with confidence
4. **Vocational preparation**: Understanding one's role in God's plan

## Developmental Focus

- **Year 9**: Faith and reason, apologetics
- **Year 10**: Epistemology and truth

## Teaching Methods

- **Debate and discussion**: Practicing argumentation and critical thinking
- **Service learning**: Connecting theory with practice
- **Mentorship**: One-on-one guidance and spiritual direction

## Challenges Addressed
