## Year 7: How Do I Live a Good Life?

**Age Range**: 12-13 years (school Year 7)  
**Core Themes**: Beatitudes, virtues and vices, moral decision-making, conscience formation  
**Primary Sources**:
- Catechism of the Catholic Church: ¬ß¬ß1691-1876
- Bible: Matthew 5-7; Galatians 5:16-26; Romans 12
- Church Documents: Veritatis Splendor; Gaudium et Spes ¬ß¬ß16-17; YouCat ¬ß¬ß279-347

### SECTION A: Driving Questions

- "How do I know what's right when everyone disagrees?"
- "Why be good when bad people seem to succeed?"
- "What if being Christian makes me unpopular?"
- "How do I become the person God wants me to be?"

> Early adolescence brings intense peer pressure and identity questions. This year grounds students in virtue ethics‚Äînot just rules but character formation. They're ready to understand morality as the art of becoming fully human.

### SECTION B: Doctrinal Content

#### Question: Whether true happiness comes from following moral rules?

**Objection 1**: It seems rules limit happiness because they prevent us from doing what we want, and happiness means getting what we want.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, many people who break rules seem happy, while good people often suffer.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, different cultures have different rules, suggesting morality is just social convention, not a path to happiness.

**On the contrary**, Jesus begins His most famous sermon with the Beatitudes‚Äîa blueprint for happiness[1](#ref-1)‚Äîwhich are moral teachings. Also, Augustine discovered: "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you"[2](#ref-2).

**I answer that** God designed us like He designed everything else‚Äîwith a purpose and nature. Just as a plant is "happy" (flourishing) when it has sun, water, and good soil, humans flourish when living according to our design.

Think of it like this: A fish is free in water but would die in "freedom" on land. Similarly, we're most free and happy within God's design, not outside it. Moral laws aren't arbitrary rules but the manufacturer's instructions for human flourishing.

The Beatitudes reveal this perfectly. They seem paradoxical:
- "Blessed are the poor in spirit"‚Äîbut don't we want confidence?
- "Blessed are those who mourn"‚Äîbut isn't happiness avoiding sadness?
- "Blessed are the meek"‚Äîbut doesn't society reward aggressiveness?

Yet Jesus is showing that true happiness comes from:
1. **Recognizing our need for God** (poor in spirit)
2. **Caring deeply about what matters** (mourning sin and injustice)
3. **Strength under control** (meekness isn't weakness)
4. **Longing for goodness** (hungering for righteousness)

**Reply to Objection 1**: Wanting the wrong things makes us miserable. It's like craving only candy‚Äîyou get sick. God's rules direct us to what truly satisfies.

**Reply to Objection 2**: Worldly success isn't true happiness. Many celebrities are miserable despite having everything. True joy comes from inner peace.

**Reply to Objection 3**: While customs vary, basic morality is universal‚Äîall cultures value truth, courage, justice, and love. These point to natural law written on our hearts[3](#ref-3).

#### Virtues: Building Spiritual Muscles

**Question**: Whether virtues can be developed or are just natural talents?

**I answer that** virtues are like muscles‚Äîeveryone has the capacity, but they grow through exercise. Even naturally kind people must work to develop heroic charity. Even naturally brave people must practice to gain true fortitude.

**The Cardinal Virtues** (natural hinges of good life):

**1. PRUDENCE** (right judgment)
- Not just being careful but seeing reality clearly
- Asking: "What's the wise thing to do?"
- Like having good GPS for life decisions
- Practice: Think before acting, seek good advice

**2. JUSTICE** (giving what's due)
- Not just fairness but right relationships
- With God (worship), others (respect), self (dignity)
- Like keeping all accounts balanced
- Practice: Keep promises, respect property, defend truth

**3. FORTITUDE** (courage)
- Not just bravery but doing right despite fear
- Endurance in trials, persistence in good
- Like spiritual weightlifting
- Practice: Stand up for someone, finish hard tasks

**4. TEMPERANCE** (moderation)
- Not being boring but enjoying rightly
- Controlling desires, not being controlled
- Like having good brakes on a car
- Practice: Delay gratification, fast occasionally

**The Theological Virtues** (supernatural gifts):

**1. FAITH** (believing God)
- Not blind belief but trust based on reasons
- Accepting revealed truth we can't fully grasp
- Like trusting the pilot though you can't fly
- Practice: Study faith, ask questions, pray the Creed

**2. HOPE** (trusting God's promises)
- Not wishful thinking but confident expectation
- Joy despite difficulties because God is faithful
- Like knowing the sun exists during storms
- Practice: Thank God for future graces, persevere

**3. CHARITY** (loving as God loves)
- Not just feeling but willing good for others
- Love of God above all, neighbor as self
- Like having God's heart transplanted into yours
- Practice: Serve without reward, forgive enemies

### SECTION C: Thinking and Reflection Activities

#### üîç Critical Thinking Tasks

**Virtue Mapping**
Create a chart:
- Situation ‚Üí Virtue needed ‚Üí Specific action
- Example: Bullying ‚Üí Fortitude ‚Üí Speak up for victim
- Find 5 real situations from your week

3. When did small compromises begin?
4. What were the consequences?

**Beatitude Translation**
Rewrite each Beatitude for your school:
- "Blessed are the meek" ‚Üí "Blessed are those who don't need to dominate conversations"
- Make them concrete and specific
- Which is hardest for your generation?

#### üß† Metacognitive Prompts

**Conscience Examination 2.0**
Not just "what did I do wrong?" but:
- What virtue did I practice today?
- What vice am I struggling with?
- When was I most fully myself?
- Where did I resist/cooperate with grace?

**Virtue Goal Setting**

#### üìñ Scripture Meditation: The Rich Young Man

**Read**: Matthew 19:16-22

**Picture It**: You're the young man. You've kept all the commandments. Jesus looks at you with love and says, "One thing you lack..." What is your "one thing"?

**Think**:
- Why wasn't following rules enough?
- What was his root attachment?
- Why did Jesus love him yet let him leave?
- What holds you back from full discipleship?

**Challenge**: Identify your "one thing" that keeps you from complete freedom. Talk to Jesus about it.

### SECTION D: Integration With Life

#### üßçüèΩ Real-World Moral Scenario

**The Group Chat Dilemma**

You're added to a group chat where friends share:
- Inappropriate memes about classmates
- Cheating strategies for tests
- Plans to lie to parents about weekend activities
- Pressure to share embarrassing photos

Options:
1. Leave silently (avoid conflict but abandon influence)
2. Stay quiet (complicit through silence)
3. Speak up (risk mockery and exclusion)
4. Private messages to individuals (divide and influence)

**Virtue Analysis**:
- **Prudence**: What's the wise approach?
- **Justice**: What do I owe my classmates being mocked?
- **Fortitude**: Can I handle being excluded?
- **Temperance**: Am I enjoying the drama?

**Possible Response**: "Hey guys, this is getting mean. We're better than this. Who wants to start a different chat for actually funny stuff?"

#### üì± Digital/Media Discernment

**Vice Algorithms**

Social media profits by amplifying vices:
- **Envy**: Comparing your life to highlights
- **Wrath**: Rage-bait and cancel culture
- **Sloth**: Endless scrolling instead of living
- **Vanity**: Obsession with likes and image
- **Lust**: Objectifying self and others

**Virtue Response**:
- Curate feeds that inspire virtue
- Time limits (temperance)
- Reality checks (prudence)
- Defend the attacked (justice)
- Share goodness (charity)

**30-Day Challenge**: Post only content that practices a virtue. Track which gets more/less engagement. What does this reveal?

#### üåè Interfaith & Pluralism

**Universal Ethics, Different Expressions**

All major traditions value virtues:
- **Buddhism**: Right action, right speech, right livelihood
- **Islam**: 99 names of God reflecting virtues
- **Hinduism**: Dharma (righteous living)
- **Judaism**: Mitzvot (commandments) forming character
- **Secular**: Human rights, character education

**Dialogue Approach**:
- "What virtues does your tradition emphasize?"
- "How do you develop good character?"
- "What helps you choose right over wrong?"
- Find common ground while noting distinctions

> Natural law means all humans recognize basic good/evil, even if expressions differ[4](#ref-4)

#### üë£ Saint of the Week: St. Maria Goretti

**The Girl Who Chose Virtue Over Life**

Maria was 11 when Alessandro, a neighbor, tried to assault her. She fought him off saying, "It is a sin! God does not want it!" He stabbed her 14 times. Dying, she forgave him: "I want him in heaven with me."

Her witness:
- Valued virtue more than life itself
- Showed heroic fortitude and chastity
- Forgave completely (charity)
- Her killer converted in prison

Modern lesson: In a hypersexualized culture, purity is possible and powerful. Virtue isn't weakness but strength.

**This Week**: Where do you need Maria's courage to say "God does not want this"?

### SECTION E: Parent Guide

#### üîç What This Year Is Really Forming

Your adolescent is developing:
1. **Character consciousness**: Seeing morality as identity, not just rules
2. **Virtue navigation**: Practical wisdom for complex situations
3. **Cultural resistance**: Strength to swim against the current
4. **Integrated morality**: Connecting faith, reason, and action
5. **Hope despite failure**: Grace-based growth mindset

#### üß† Theology Behind the Simplicity

**Natural Law Theory**[5](#ref-5)
Written on human hearts:
- **Preservation of life**: Why suicide/murder feel wrong
- **Procreation/education**: Why family matters
- **Social life**: Why we need community
- **Truth seeking**: Why lies disturb us
- **Worship**: Why humans universally reach beyond

These incline us toward virtue naturally.

**Virtue Ethics vs. Deontology vs. Consequentialism**
- **Virtue Ethics**: Who should I become? (Catholic emphasis)
- **Deontology**: What rules apply? (Kant)
- **Consequentialism**: What produces best outcomes? (Mill)

Catholic morality integrates all three with virtue primary.

**Habitus (Habits)**[6](#ref-6)
- Virtues/vices are habits, not isolated acts
- Formed through repetition
- Become "second nature"
- Create ease in good/evil
- Can be changed with grace and effort

**Conscience Formation**[7](#ref-7)
Conscience must be:
1. **Informed** by truth (not just feelings)
2. **Formed** through practice
3. **Examined** regularly
4. **Followed** when certain
5. **Corrected** when erring

#### üõ† How to Respond When...

**"Everyone else is doing it!"**
"I hear you, and I know it's hard to be different. But let me ask: If everyone jumped off a bridge, would that make it safe? Truth isn't determined by majority vote. Also, 'everyone' is usually exaggerated‚Äîthere are others making good choices too, you just might not see them. Here's what's true: You're called to be a leader, not a follower. The saints were often alone in their stands. What matters isn't what 'everyone' does but what the person God created you to be would do. Let's talk about specific strategies for handling this pressure..."

**"Good people finish last"**
"It does seem that way sometimes! But let's examine what 'finishing first' means. If it means money and power at any cost, then yes, ruthless people often get those. But do they get peace? Real friendships? Clear consciences? The ability to look their children in the eye? Also, think long-term: Bernie Madoff 'won' for decades then died in prison. Lance Armstrong had seven Tour titles, all stripped. Meanwhile, people like Fred Rogers or Mother Teresa 'lost' by worldly standards but left legacies of love. What kind of 'finishing first' do you actually want?"

**"These rules are outdated"**
"Which ones specifically? Let's examine them. Some Church disciplines (like fasting rules) do change with time and culture. But moral principles (like the Ten Commandments) are based on human nature, which doesn't change. Gravity is an 'old' law‚Äîshould we ignore it because it's ancient? The Church's moral teachings have produced saints in every century, in every culture. They've been tested by millions and found reliable. What seems 'outdated' might actually be countercultural wisdom. But I'm open‚Äîwhich teaching troubles you and why?"

**"I keep failing at the same sin"**
"Welcome to the human condition! Even St. Paul said, 'I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want'[8](#ref-8). Here's the key: God's mercy is bigger than your weakness. Every saint had habitual sins they battled. What matters is you keep fighting. Think of it like learning a sport‚Äîyou fail repeatedly before succeeding. Three helps: 1) Identify what triggers this sin and avoid those situations, 2) Replace the vice with its opposite virtue actively, 3) Use sacraments frequently‚ÄîConfession gives grace, not just forgiveness. Progress, not perfection, is the goal."

#### üõë What Not To Say

‚ùå "Just follow the rules"
‚úÖ Say: "Let's understand why this leads to flourishing"

‚ùå "Because I said so"
‚úÖ Say: "Here's the wisdom behind this boundary..."

‚ùå "You're bad for struggling"
‚úÖ Say: "Your struggles show you're fighting‚Äîthat's good!"

‚ùå "Morality is just common sense"
‚úÖ Say: "Morality takes wisdom, which we develop together"

‚ùå "Wait until you're older to understand"
‚úÖ Say: "This is complex, but let's explore what you can grasp now"
