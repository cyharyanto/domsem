## Year 12: What Is My Mission?

**Age Range**: 17-18 years (school Year 12)
**Core Themes**: Evangelization, vocation, spiritual warfare, redemptive suffering, eschatology, preparing for adult faith.
**Primary Sources**:
-   Catechism of the Catholic Church: §§976-1065 (The Last Things), 2558-2758 (Prayer, Spiritual Battle)
-   Bible: Matthew 28:16-20 (The Great Commission); Ephesians 6:10-20 (Armor of God); Colossians 1:24; 1 Peter 5:8-9
-   Church Documents: *Evangelii Nuntiandi* (Paul VI), *Redemptoris Missio* (John Paul II), *Christifideles Laici* (John Paul II)

### SECTION A: Driving Questions

-   "Now that I'm graduating, how do I keep my faith alive without my family, school, or youth group?"
-   "What does God actually want me to *do* with my life? How do I figure out my vocation?"
-   "Why does being a serious Christian sometimes feel like a battle? Is 'spiritual warfare' a real thing?"
-   "What's the point of suffering? Does it have any meaning?"

> This capstone year is about commissioning. The student has been formed; now they are being sent. The focus shifts from receiving catechesis to living a personal mission. It directly addresses the transition to adulthood, equipping the young disciple with the spiritual and practical tools for a resilient, fruitful, and courageous faith in a secular world.

### SECTION B: Doctrinal Content

#### Question: Whether every Catholic is called to be a missionary?

**Objection 1**: It seems not, for missionaries are special priests or religious who travel to foreign lands. Most people are called to ordinary lives as doctors, parents, or teachers.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, evangelizing is aggressive and disrespectful. We should respect others' beliefs, not try to change them.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, I am not holy or knowledgeable enough to be a missionary. That role should be left to the experts.

**On the contrary**, the Second Vatican Council teaches that "the whole Church is missionary, and the work of evangelization is a basic duty of the People of God"[¹⁶⁰](#ref-160). And Christ's final command was "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations"[¹⁶¹](#ref-161).

**I answer that** by virtue of our Baptism, every single Catholic is incorporated into Christ's threefold office of Prophet, Priest, and King, and is therefore sent on mission. We must distinguish, however, between the *universal call to evangelize* and the *specific vocation to missionary work*.

-   **The Mission Field is Everywhere**: Your university campus, your future workplace, your friendship circle, your own family—these are the "nations" you are sent to.
-   **Evangelization is Attraction**: The primary method of evangelization is not argument but witness. Pope Benedict XVI said, "The Church does not engage in proselytism. Instead, she grows by 'attraction'." People should be drawn to Christ by seeing the joy, peace, and love in your life.
-   **The Great Proposal**: We do not impose the faith; we propose it as the answer to the deepest longings of the human heart. We are offering a treasure, not forcing a burden.

The call is not to be weird, but to be radiant. It's to be so filled with the love and truth of Christ that your life becomes a compelling question to which only He is the answer.

**Reply to Objection 1**: This confuses the universal mission with a particular form of it. A mother evangelizes by raising her children in the faith. A doctor evangelizes by treating patients with profound dignity. An artist evangelizes by creating works of beauty that awaken a longing for God. All are missionaries in their own state of life.

**Reply to Objection 2**: This confuses proposing with imposing. It is not disrespectful to share what you believe to be the most beautiful and important truth in the world. It is, in fact, an act of supreme love. True respect means taking another person's eternal destiny seriously enough to offer them the Gospel.

**Reply to Objection 3**: The apostles were uneducated fishermen. The saints were sinners. The Holy Spirit works through our weakness. Your mission is not to be a perfect expert, but a joyful witness. Your testimony of how Christ has worked in your own imperfect life is more powerful than any theological treatise.

#### Question: Whether a Christian should expect a life of peace or a life of battle?

**Objection 1**: It seems we should expect peace, for Christ is the "Prince of Peace"[¹⁶²](#ref-162) and He promised His followers a "peace the world cannot give"[¹⁶³](#ref-163).

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, if God is all-powerful, our spiritual life should be one of serene progress, not constant struggle.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, the idea of a "devil" and "demons" seems like a primitive superstition that modern psychology has explained away as internal conflict or mental illness.

**On the contrary**, the *Catechism* states, "This dramatic situation of 'the whole world [which] is in the power of the evil one' makes man's life a battle... a hard battle against the powers of darkness"[¹⁶⁴](#ref-164).

**I answer that** the Christian life is a paradox of deep peace in the midst of a relentless battle. We are engaged in **spiritual warfare**. This is not a metaphor. It is the reality of living in a fallen world, contending against three primary enemies:

1.  **The World**: The system of values, priorities, and pressures contrary to the Gospel (e.g., materialism, hedonism, relativism).
2.  **The Flesh**: Our own disordered desires and concupiscence; the inclination to sin that remains even after Baptism.
3.  **The Devil**: A real, personal, spiritual being (Satan) and his fallen angels (demons) who hate God and humanity and seek to "prowl around the world seeking the ruin of souls"[¹⁶⁵](#ref-165).

The peace Christ gives is not the absence of conflict, but the deep interior calm and confidence that comes from knowing the war has already been won. Christ's victory on the Cross is definitive. Our life is the "mopping up" operation, claiming the territory of our own souls and the world for the victorious King. We fight *from* victory, not *for* it. For this, God has given us spiritual armor (Ephesians 6) and powerful weapons: the Sacraments (especially the Eucharist and Confession), prayer (especially the Rosary), fasting, and the intercession of the saints.

**Reply to Objection 1**: The peace of Christ is the tranquility of order in the soul, which can coexist with external persecution and internal struggle. The martyrs had this peace even as the lions attacked.

**Reply to Objection 2**: The struggle is a sign that you are alive and fighting, not a sign that God is weak. A dead fish flows with the stream; only a live one can swim against it. The struggle is permitted by God to strengthen our virtue and deepen our dependence on His grace.

**Reply to Objection 3**: While some conditions are indeed psychological, Jesus and the saints consistently acted as if the devil were a real, personal adversary. To dismiss this is to claim to know better than Christ Himself. The spiritual and psychological are not mutually exclusive; a spiritual being can certainly exploit psychological weaknesses. Prudence requires us to use both the best spiritual *and* psychological resources.

#### Question: Whether suffering is meaningless?

**Objection 1**: It seems so, for suffering is by definition the experience of evil, which is the absence of good and meaning.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, a good God would want us to be happy. Therefore, suffering must be contrary to His will and pointless.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, telling people their suffering has a purpose is a cruel way to justify their pain and avoid the duty of alleviating it.

**On the contrary**, St. Paul writes, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church"[¹⁶⁶](#ref-166).

**I answer that** in itself, suffering is an evil. But through the Cross of Christ, suffering can be transformed into a means of grace, love, and salvation. This concept of **redemptive suffering** is one of the most unique and profound aspects of Christianity.

Christ did not eliminate suffering, but He entered into it. By uniting His divine personhood with human suffering on the Cross, He infused it with redemptive power. Now, when we unite our own sufferings—big or small, physical or emotional—with His, they are no longer meaningless. They become a participation in His saving work.

-   A student's suffering through a difficult exam, offered for a friend who has left the faith.
-   An athlete's suffering during training, offered for the conversion of sinners.
-   A sick person's suffering in a hospital bed, offered for the souls in purgatory.

These acts have real, objective, spiritual power. This does not mean we seek out suffering (that would be masochism). It means that when suffering inevitably finds us, we do not have to waste it. We can turn the greatest apparent evil in our lives into our most powerful act of love.

**Reply to Objection 1**: The Cross transforms the logic. What was an absence of good becomes a superabundance of grace. The "emptiness" of suffering becomes a vessel to be filled with Christ's own redeeming love.

**Reply to Objection 2**: God's ultimate desire for our happiness is our eternal union with Him. Sometimes, the path to that deepest happiness involves the temporary pain of purification, discipline, and sacrificial love, just as an athlete's training is painful but leads to the joy of victory.

**Reply to Objection 3**: The doctrine of redemptive suffering does not remove our duty to alleviate pain. It complements it. We should work to end all suffering we can. But for the suffering that we *cannot* eliminate (e.g., a terminal illness, a tragic loss), the faith offers not a justification, but a meaning and a purpose. It gives the sufferer agency and dignity, turning them from a passive victim into an active participant in the salvation of the world.

### SECTION C: Thinking and Reflection Activities

#### 🔍 Critical Thinking Tasks

**Personal Vocation Statement**
Based on your gifts, passions, and the needs you see in the world, write a first draft of a personal mission statement. Use this template: "My mission is to use my God-given gifts of [list 2-3 gifts] to [action verb] in the area of [a need you care about], so that [the ultimate goal, related to God's glory]."

**Spiritual Warfare Analysis**
For one week, keep a log. Identify moments of temptation or spiritual struggle. Categorize the source:
-   **The World**: Was it pressure from a cultural value?
-   **The Flesh**: Was it an internal disordered desire?
-   **The Devil**: Was it an irrational, despairing, or accusatory thought that seemed to come from outside?
What "armor" or "weapon" would be most effective in each case?

**Redemptive Suffering Offering**
Think of one unavoidable suffering in your life right now (e.g., stress about exams, a difficult relationship, a physical ailment). Write a formal prayer offering it to God for a specific intention, consciously uniting it with the sufferings of Christ. Notice if this changes your experience of the suffering.

#### 🧠 Metacognitive Prompts

**Exit Interview with Yourself**
As you prepare to graduate, reflect:
- "What is the most important truth I've learned in the last 12 years of formation?"
- "What is the area of my faith that is weakest and needs the most attention in the next two years?"
- "How has my image of God changed from Year 1 to Year 12?"
- "What spiritual habits will I commit to keeping when no one is watching?"

#### 📖 Scripture Meditation: The Great Commission

**Read**: Matthew 28:16-20
"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations... And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

**Picture It**: You are there on the mountain with the apostles. Jesus gives this command directly to you. What is your first reaction? Fear? Excitement? Inadequacy?

**Think**:
- Jesus says "Go," not "Wait until you're perfect." What does that imply?
- The command is not just to "convert" but to "make disciples." What's the difference?
- The command is bookended by a statement of authority ("All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me") and a promise of presence ("I am with you always"). How do these two statements make the command possible?

### SECTION D: Integration With Life

#### 🧍🏽 Real-World Moral Scenario

**The University Orientation Week**
You arrive at university. You're invited to a party where there is heavy drinking, casual drug use, and a "hook-up" culture is the norm. Everyone seems to be participating. You feel immense pressure to fit in and a deep sense of loneliness and isolation if you don't.

**Thinking as a Disciple on Mission**:
1.  **Identify the Battle**: This is a direct encounter with "the World." The lie being offered is that belonging comes through conformity to sin.
2.  **Recall Your Identity**: "I am a beloved child of God, a temple of the Holy Spirit. My body is for love, not for use."
3.  **Use Your Armor**:
    -   *Belt of Truth*: The truth about your dignity and the true meaning of joy.
    -   *Shield of Faith*: Trust that God's plan is better than what's being offered.
    -   *Sword of the Spirit*: A memorized verse, like "Do not be conformed to this world" (Romans 12:2).
4.  **Strategic Action (Prudence)**: You don't have to preach a sermon. You can simply say, "No thanks, I'm good," and leave. Or, even better, find the one or two other people who also look uncomfortable and start a real conversation with them. Your mission might be to find the *other* lonely people.
5.  **Seek Reinforcements**: Find the Catholic student center or campus ministry on day one. You cannot fight this battle alone.

#### 📱 Digital/Media Discernment

**Crafting a "Rule of Life" for Technology**
As an adult, you will no longer have parents setting your screen time rules. You must set your own.
-   **Create a Personal "Digital Rule of Life."** Be specific.
    -   *Time*: When will my phone be on/off? (e.g., off an hour before bed and after waking).
    -   *Place*: Where will my phone not go? (e.g., the dinner table, the bathroom, the chapel).
    -   *Content*: What accounts will I unfollow? What will I intentionally follow?
    -   *Purpose*: Before picking up my phone, I will ask, "What is my mission right now?"

#### 🌏 Interfaith & Pluralism

**Vocation and Mission in Other Faiths**
-   **Judaism**: A strong sense of being a "chosen people" called to be a "light to the nations," primarily through faithful observance of the Torah.
-   **Islam**: The concept of *Dawah* (inviting others to Islam) is a key duty, though methods vary. Every Muslim is a witness to the unity of God.
-   **Buddhism**: The Bodhisattva ideal is a being who postpones their own nirvana out of compassion to help all other sentient beings achieve enlightenment.

**Dialogue Point**: The Christian mission is unique in that it is centered on a Person, not a system or a set of laws. We are not just inviting people to a better philosophy, but to a relationship with the living God in Jesus Christ.

#### 👣 Saint of the Week: St. José Sánchez del Río

**The Boy Martyr of the Cristero War**

"Joselito" was a 14-year-old boy in Mexico during the Cristero War, when the government was brutally persecuting the Catholic Church. He begged to join the Cristero fighters. They let him be a flag-bearer.

He was captured and tortured, ordered to renounce Christ. The soles of his feet were cut, and he was forced to walk to the cemetery. His torturers tried to make him say "Death to Christ the King." Instead, with every step, he shouted, "¡Viva Cristo Rey!" ("Long live Christ the King!"). He was shot, tracing a cross in the dirt with his own blood as he died.

**His Witness**:
-   You are never too young for a heroic mission.
-   Faith is worth more than life itself.
-   Suffering can be transformed into a final, powerful act of witness.
-   His last cry, "Viva Cristo Rey!", is the summary of the entire Christian mission.

### SECTION E: Parent Guide

#### 🔍 What This Year Is Really Forming

-   **Spiritual Adulthood**: The transition from a faith that is supported by structures to a faith that supports the person when structures are gone.
-   **Apostolic Identity**: An ingrained sense of being "sent."
-   **Vocational Clarity**: The ability to see one's entire life—career, relationships, etc.—as a response to God's call.
-   **Spiritual Resilience**: The practical skills and theological understanding to persevere through dryness, doubt, and spiritual attack.
-   **Eschatological Hope**: A life lived in light of eternity, giving urgency and joy to the present moment.

#### 🧠 Theology Behind the Simplicity

-   **The Great Commission**: This is not the "Great Suggestion." It is the final marching order of the King, defining the fundamental posture of the Church until the end of time.
-   **Discernment of Spirits**: The Ignatian practice of distinguishing between "consolations" (which lead toward God) and "desolations" (which lead away from Him). This is a crucial skill for adult faith.
-   **Eschatology**: The theology of the "Last Things" (death, judgment, heaven, hell). Far from being morbid, a healthy eschatology is what gives life meaning, value, and urgency. It is the answer to the question, "Where is this all going?"
-   ***Christifideles Laici***: John Paul II's exhortation on the vocation and mission of the lay faithful. It is a powerful charter for understanding that the work of the Church is not just for priests and nuns, but for every baptized person in the midst of the world.

#### 🛠 How to Respond When...

**"I don't know what my vocation is, and I'm stressed about picking a university/career."**
"That feeling is completely normal. First, remember your primary vocation is to holiness—to become a saint. That is true no matter what career you choose or whether you get married. Your state of life (marriage, priesthood, etc.) and your career are the *ways* you will live out that primary call. Don't think of it as one single decision you have to get right. Think of it as a series of faithful 'yeses' to God. Pray, 'God, what do you want me to do *today*?' Be faithful in the small things, and He will lead you. The saints didn't have a 10-year plan; they just followed the next right step in love."

**"The idea of a devil trying to attack me is terrifying. I don't want to think about it."**
"I understand. It can be a scary thought. But here's the good news: 'the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.'[¹⁶⁷](#ref-167) Spiritual warfare is real, but we are on the winning side. It's like being a soldier for a king who has already won the war. We don't have to be afraid, just prepared. Knowing the enemy's tactics is how we stay safe. The best defense is a good offense: a life of prayer, frequent sacraments, and charity. The devil is a coward; he flees from a soul that is close to Christ."

**"My suffering just feels pointless and awful. This 'redemptive suffering' thing sounds like a nice platitude."**
"You're right. It can sound like a platitude, and we should never say it to someone in a way that dismisses their real pain. And it's okay to feel that your suffering is pointless—that is part of the suffering itself. But the invitation of faith is to make an act of trust, even when you don't feel it. Can you, just for a moment, say, 'Jesus, I don't understand this, I hate this, but I give it to you. Use it somehow.' You don't have to feel the meaning for it to be there. Your small act of trust allows Him to unite your pain to His Cross and make it powerful, even if you never see how in this life."

#### 🙏🏽 Liturgical Practices

-   **A "Sending" Mass**: Before your child leaves for university or work, ask your priest to offer a Mass for them, perhaps with a special blessing at the end.
-   **The Anointing of the Sick**: If a family member is seriously ill, don't be afraid of this sacrament. It is a powerful encounter with the healing Christ and a profound lesson in redemptive suffering.
-   **Praying the Litany of the Saints**: This is a powerful prayer that reminds us we are part of a vast army of heavenly helpers in our spiritual battle.
-   **The Examen Prayer (Ignatian)**: This daily prayer practice is one of the best tools for developing discernment and finding God's will in the details of ordinary life.

#### 📚 Further Adult Reading

-   **Church Documents**: *Evangelii Nuntiandi* (Paul VI), *Redemptoris Missio* (JPII), *Christifideles Laici* (JPII).
-   **Spiritual Classics**: *The Screwtape Letters* (C.S. Lewis), *Introduction to the Devout Life* (St. Francis de Sales), *The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius*.
-   **Modern Works**: *The Fulfillment of All Desire* (Ralph Martin), *Strangers in a Strange Land* (Archbishop Charles Chaput), *From Christendom to Apostolic Mission* (University of Mary).

### SECTION F: Self-Reading Guide
