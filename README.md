**A Resource for Parents, the "First Heralds" of the Faith for their Children**

---

> "Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive the responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children. Parents should initiate their children at an early age into the mysteries of the faith of which they are the 'first heralds' for their children."
>
> — *Catechism of the Catholic Church* §2225

## What is Domestic Seminary?

This project is a response to the Church's profound teaching on the family as the *ecclesia domestica*, the domestic church. It is a comprehensive, faithful, and practical resource designed to help Catholic parents fulfill their beautiful mission: to initiate their children into the mysteries of the faith and to teach them to discover their vocation as children of God.

**Domestic Seminary** is not meant to replace parish life, but to help a "wholesome family life foster interior dispositions that are a genuine preparation for a living faith," a faith that will remain a support throughout your child's life.

## How to Use This Book

The Church teaches that "family catechesis precedes, accompanies, and enriches other forms of instruction in the faith." This curriculum is designed to be used in all three ways:

-   **To Precede**: For young children (Part I: Pre-School), this material serves as their very first initiation into the faith, happening in the warmth and love of the home, long before formal schooling begins.

-   **To Accompany**: For children attending Catholic schools or parish religious education, this curriculum can be used to accompany their formal learning, providing a way for parents to deepen the lessons, connect them to family life, and answer the questions that arise during the week.

-   **To Enrich**: For families whose children attend secular schools, this curriculum becomes a primary tool to enrich their children's lives with a robust and intelligent understanding of the Catholic faith, equipping them for confident engagement with the world.

## A Privileged Place: Your Role with the Parish

This curriculum is designed to strengthen your family's bond with your local parish, never to replace it. As the Catechism reminds us, "The parish is the Eucharistic community and the heart of the liturgical life of Christian families; it is a privileged place for the catechesis of children and parents." (§2226)

Our hope is that by using this guide, your family's participation in the Mass will become richer, your understanding of the sacraments deeper, and your connection to your parish community stronger.

## Core Principles

1.  **Fidelity to the Magisterium**: All doctrinal content is rooted in the Catechism, Sacred Scripture, and official Church documents.
2.  **Formation in Step with Life**: The spiral curriculum revisits core truths at increasing levels of depth, respecting your child's developmental stages.
3.  **A "Both/And" Vision**: This curriculum intentionally embraces the Catholic genius for holding truths in tension: faith *and* reason, Scripture *and* Tradition, liturgy *and* justice, contemplation *and* action.
4.  **A Living Path**: This is not a static textbook but a living project, designed to be continuously developed and corrected.
5.  **A Gift Freely Given**: Offered under a Creative Commons license, this work is free for all families to use and adapt for non-commercial purposes.

## A Note on Generation

This curriculum was developed by human catechists in a dialectical partnership with a Large Language Model (LLM). The methodology was designed to leverage the generative power of AI while ensuring strict doctrinal alignment through a human-led, source-first process. The LLM acts as a powerful catechetical assistant, always subordinate to the Magisterium and the guiding hand of a human catechist. Any errors that remain are human errors in this process.
