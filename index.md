**Authorial Declaration**

This document is a public, non-commercial act of faith by Catholic parents in obedience to the teaching of the Church:

> "Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children in the faith, prayer, and all the virtues." â€” Catechism of the Catholic Church Â§2252

It is not intended as a substitute for parish, diocesan, or magisterial formation programs, but as a living expression of the domestic Church in full communion with the teachings of the Catholic faith.

**Development Statement**

This first public release, Version 0.1, is an **unreviewed draft**. While every effort has been made to ensure doctrinal fidelity and accurate citation from magisterial sources, it should be considered a work in progress. Readers may find referential errors, underdeveloped narratives, or areas requiring deeper theological nuance. These imperfections are part of its nature as a 'living document.' Readers and communities who use this text are invited not as passive consumers, but as collaborators in its refinement.

In this spirit, this catechetical curriculum is not a final word, but a living path. Like the faith it transmits, it is:

-   **Continuously developed**, not fixed in time
-   **Subject to repentance**, where it misframes, excludes, or misguides
-   **Rooted in tradition**, yet open to the real questions of each generation
-   **Collectively carried**, meant to be reviewed, corrected, and expanded by families, priests, theologians, teachers, and seekers

In this spirit, it is released under a Creative Commons BY-NC license, inviting collaboration but forbidding commercialization, to protect its vocation as a gift freely given.

**A Note on Generation and Methodology**

This curriculum was developed in a dialectical partnership with a Large Language Model (LLM). The methodology was designed to leverage the generative power of AI while ensuring strict doctrinal alignment through a human-led, source-first process:

1.  **Human Direction**: The entire structure, pedagogical approach, and thematic content were architected by the authors.
2.  **Source-Grounded Generation**: The LLM was instructed to generate content *only* when it could be directly cited from or grounded in primary sources: the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Sacred Scripture, and official Church documents.
3.  **Doctrinal Scrutiny**: All generated text, especially doctrinal explanations, was reviewed and refined by the authors to ensure it accurately reflects the mind of the Church.
4.  **Pedagogical Adaptation**: The Scholastic and narrative style was a deliberate human choice, with the LLM acting as a tool to format and articulate these structures.

This process treats the LLM not as an authority, but as a powerful catechetical assistant, always subordinate to the Magisterium and the guiding hand of a human catechist. Any errors that remain are human errors in this process, for which we take full responsibility.
