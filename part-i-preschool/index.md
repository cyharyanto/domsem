# Part I — Pre-School Formation (Birth to Age 5)

This section covers the foundational years of faith formation, from birth to age 5. During this period, children develop their sacramental imagination and learn to encounter God through their senses, daily routines, and family life.

## Overview

The pre-school years are crucial for establishing the foundation of faith. During this period, children learn through:

- **Sensory experiences**: Holy water, candles, incense, sacred art
- **Daily routines**: Meal blessings, bedtime prayers, morning offerings
- **Family rituals**: Sign of the cross, parental blessings, liturgical seasons
- **Imaginative play**: Bible stories, saint tales, dramatic reenactments

This formation happens naturally within the rhythm of family life, creating what we call a "sacramental ecology" where the holy is encountered in the everyday.

## Key Principles

1. **Grace builds on nature**: We work with, not against, the child's natural development
2. **Incarnational approach**: The invisible is known through the visible
3. **Domestic monastery**: The home becomes the first place of prayer and formation
4. **Trust as foundation**: Consistent care teaches children about God's providence

## Developmental Milestones

- **Birth to 12 months**: Foundation of trust through reliable care
- **12-24 months**: Learning that the world has meaning and purpose
- **2-3 years**: Beginning to participate in family prayer and rituals
- **3-4 years**: Stories shape reality; imaginative theology begins
- **4-5 years**: Preparing for formal learning and school integration
