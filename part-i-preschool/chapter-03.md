## Chapter 3: First Prayers and Sacred Touch

### The Language of Heaven Begins with Babbling

Before your child can pronounce "theological," they can pray. Before they understand transubstantiation, they can experience the sacred through touch. This chapter explores how to introduce the youngest children to prayer as a natural conversation with God who is already present, already listening, already loving.

> "Unless you become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven"[¹](#ref-1). Perhaps this is because children already know what we adults forget: that prayer is fundamentally about relationship, not performance.

### Theological Foundation: Can Babies Pray?

**Question**: Whether infants and toddlers can truly pray?

**Objection 1**: It would seem that infants cannot pray, for prayer requires intention, and babies lack rational intention.

**Objection 2**: Furthermore, prayer is the lifting of the mind and heart to God[²](#ref-2), but infants have no concept of God to whom they might lift their hearts.

**Objection 3**: Moreover, if babies could pray, baptism would be unnecessary, for they would already be in communion with God.

**On the contrary**, the Psalmist declares, "From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise"[³](#ref-3). Additionally, St. Thérèse of Lisieux speaks of her earliest memories being suffused with awareness of God's presence[⁴](#ref-4).

**I answer that** prayer admits of degrees. In its highest form, prayer is indeed the conscious lifting of mind and heart to God. But prayer begins more fundamentally as the orientation of one's being toward the divine. 

Consider three levels of prayer:
1. **Ontological prayer**: The very being of the baptized oriented toward God
2. **Affective prayer**: The movement of the heart toward goodness, beauty, love
3. **Conceptual prayer**: The mind's conscious address to God

Infants are capable of the first two levels. When a baby reaches toward beauty, responds to love, or rests in peaceful trust, they participate in prayer's essence. The parent's role is to give words and form to what the child already experiences.

**Reply to Objection 1**: Rational intention is the fullness of prayer, not its beginning. Just as a plant turns toward sun before it "knows" what light is, so the child's soul turns toward God before conceptual knowledge.

**Reply to Objection 2**: The infant knows God not conceptually but experientially—through the love of parents, the beauty of creation, the peace of blessing. These mediate divine presence truly, if imperfectly.

**Reply to Objection 3**: Baptism does not create the capacity for prayer but elevates it to the supernatural order. The baptized infant prays in Christ, not merely as creature to Creator.

### The Development of Prayer: From Touch to Words

#### Stage 1: Prayer as Sacred Touch (0-12 months)

At this stage, prayer is primarily communicated through the body. The parent is the priest, the child's body is the altar, and gentle touch mediates blessing.

**The Blessing Touch**
- **Tracing the cross**: On forehead, lips, heart
- **Hands on head**: Biblical gesture of blessing
- **Holding during prayer**: Child feels the physical rhythm of parent's prayer
- **Sacred massage**: Infant massage with blessing words

**First Prayer Words** (spoken by parent for child)
- "God loves [Name]"
- "Thank you, God, for [Name]"
- "Keep [Name] safe"
- "Bless [Name]'s sleep"

**Prayer Positions**
- Held against parent's chest during prayer
- Gentle rocking while singing sacred songs
- Lifted up during "Glory to God in the highest"

> When John Paul II visited a children's hospital, he spent longest with the infants, tracing crosses on tiny foreheads. When asked why, he replied, "They understand blessing better than anyone."

#### Stage 2: Prayer as Imitation (12-24 months)

The toddler begins to mimic sacred gestures before understanding their meaning. This is not "empty ritual" but embodied learning.

**Gestures to Introduce**
- **Sign of the Cross**: Begin with hand-over-hand guidance
- **Folded hands**: For brief moments
- **"Amen"**: Their first verbal prayer
- **Kiss the cross**: Gentle reverence
- **Genuflection**: Supported by parent

**Simple Prayer Formulas**
- Morning: "Good morning, God!"
- Meals: "Thank you, God" (clap after if desired)
- Night: "God bless Mama, Dada, [siblings]"
- Distress: "Help, God!"

**Sacred Songs as Prayer**
- "Jesus Loves Me": Theology of divine love
- "This Little Light": Vocation to witness
- Traditional lullabies: "Salve Regina," "Panis Angelicus" (the tune carries prayer)

#### Stage 3: Prayer as Conversation (2-3 years)

The child begins to understand prayer as talking to Someone, not just something we do.

**The Three Essential Prayers**
1. **Thank You**: "Thank you, God, for..." (let child fill in)
2. **Please**: "Please help..." (specific needs)
3. **Sorry**: "Sorry, God, for..." (gentle introduction to contrition)

**Expanding Prayer Vocabulary**
- Names for God: Father, Jesus, Holy Spirit
- Prayer adjectives: good, loving, strong, kind
- Prayer verbs: love, help, bless, keep safe

**First Memorized Prayers**
Focus on one at a time, with gestures:

**Sign of the Cross**
"In the name" (touch forehead)
"of the Father" (touch chest)
"and of the Son" (touch left shoulder)
"and of the Holy Spirit" (touch right shoulder)
"Amen" (fold hands)

**Simple Our Father**
"Our Father in heaven,
We love your name.
Thank you for everything.
Help us be good.
Amen."

#### Stage 4: Prayer as Relationship (3-4 years)

The child begins to initiate prayer and understand God as a Person who listens.

**Spontaneous Prayer Encouragement**
- "What do you want to tell God?"
- "God is listening. What's in your heart?"
- "Shall we talk to Jesus about that?"

**Prayer Throughout the Day**
- See a flower: "Thank you, God, for beauty"
- Hear a siren: "God, help whoever needs help"
- Feel scared: "Jesus, stay close to me"
- Do wrong: "I'm sorry. Help me do better"

**Traditional Prayers with Understanding**

**Hail Mary** (introduce slowly)
"Hail Mary" (Hello, Mary)
"Full of grace" (God loves you so much)
"The Lord is with thee" (God is always with you)
"Blessed art thou among women" (You're the best mommy)
"And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus" (Thank you for baby Jesus)

**Guardian Angel Prayer**
"Angel of God, my guardian dear,
To whom God's love commits me here,
Ever this day be at my side,
To light and guard, to rule and guide. Amen."

#### Stage 5: Prayer as Practice (4-5 years)

The child can now engage in simple prayer practices and understand basic prayer postures.

**Introduction to Meditation**
- Gospel scene imagination: "Close your eyes. See Jesus..."
- Sacred art contemplation: "What do you see? How does it make you feel?"
- Nature prayer: "What is creation telling us about God?"

**Prayer Postures and Their Meanings**
- **Kneeling**: "We're little, God is big"
- **Standing**: "We're ready to serve"
- **Prostration**: "You are everything, God"
- **Hands raised**: "We're reaching for heaven"
- **Hands folded**: "We're holding our prayers"

**Family Prayer Formats**
- **Prayer circle**: Hold hands, each person adds one prayer
- **Echo prayer**: Parent says line, child repeats
- **Song prayer**: Sing prayers together
- **Walking prayer**: Prayer while moving through house/garden

### Common Challenges in Teaching Prayer

#### "My Child Won't Be Still"

**Question**: Whether children must be still to pray?

**I answer that** stillness is one form of prayer, not its only form. King David danced before the Lord[⁵](#ref-5). Children often pray best through:
- Movement prayers with gestures
- Walking while talking to God
- Dancing to sacred music
- Active prayer (cleaning as prayer, helping as prayer)

The goal is focused attention, not frozen bodies.

#### "My Child's Prayers Seem Silly"

**Actual prayers from children**:
- "God, thank you for chicken nuggets"
- "Please make my goldfish not dead"
- "Help daddy's hair grow back"

**These are excellent prayers because**:
- They're honest (God values truth over sophistication)
- They're trusting (believing God cares about everything)
- They're specific (not vague spirituality)

Never correct the content, only gently guide the form.

#### "Prayer Feels Like a Battle"

**For the resistant child**:
- Make it brief (10 seconds is still prayer)
- Make it tactile (hold a cross, light a candle)
- Make it musical (sing instead of speak)
- Make it their choice ("What prayer shall we do?")
- Model more than mandate

**Remember**: You're planting seeds, not forcing growth. Some seeds take years to sprout.

### Sacred Touch: The Forgotten Sacramental

Modern culture has made us suspicious of touch, for good protective reasons. But appropriate sacred touch remains essential for forming children in faith. Here's how to maintain both safety and sacredness:

#### The Theology of Sacred Touch

**In Scripture**:
- Jesus touched children to bless them[⁶](#ref-6)
- Laying on of hands conveys blessing[⁷](#ref-7)
- The Father's embrace welcomes the prodigal[⁸](#ref-8)

**In Tradition**:
- Parents have authority to bless
- Sacramentals work through material means
- The body is temple of the Holy Spirit[⁹](#ref-9)

#### Appropriate Sacred Touch

**Daily Blessings**:
- Cross traced on forehead
- Hands placed on head
- Holy water sprinkled
- Brief embrace during prayer

**Liturgical Touch**:
- Sign of peace at home
- Holding hands during Our Father
- Blessed oil for sickness
- Blessing before travel

**Healing Touch**:
- Prayer with hand on injured spot
- Blessing during illness
- Reconciliation hugs
- Comfort during fear

#### Creating Safe Sacred Space

**Clear Boundaries**:
- Sacred touch is always clothed
- Sacred touch is brief and purposeful
- Sacred touch is visible to others
- Sacred touch respects the child's comfort

**Teaching Consent**:
- "Would you like a blessing?"
- "You can say no to any touch"
- "Your body is holy and yours"
- Distinguish between sacred and inappropriate touch

### The Fruits of Early Prayer Formation

### A Parent's Prayer for Teaching Prayer

*Holy Spirit, divine Teacher, help me teach my child to pray. When I feel inadequate, remind me that you pray within us with groanings too deep for words. Give me patience when prayer feels like a struggle, creativity when routine grows stale, and trust that you are working even when I see no fruit. May my child learn from me that prayer is not performance but presence, not achievement but relationship. Through Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Father, one God forever and ever. Amen.*
