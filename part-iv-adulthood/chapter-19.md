## Chapter 19: The Faith Grows With You - Living Catholic Adulthood

This chapter is for the young adult. Your formation does not end with graduation. Adulthood is where the faith is truly tested and becomes your own.

**A Rule of Life for the Young Adult Catholic:**

1.  **The Sacramental Core**: Find a parish and make it your home. Go to Mass every Sunday, even when you are tired or don't feel like it. Go to Confession at least once a month. This is your non-negotiable spiritual lifeline.
2.  **Daily Prayer**: Establish a simple, consistent routine. A Morning Offering, 15 minutes of mental prayer with Scripture, and a nightly Examen. Without this, your faith will wither.
3.  **Community**: You cannot survive as a lone-wolf Catholic. Find the Catholic student center, a young adult group, or start a small faith-sharing group with a few friends. "Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them."[¹⁶⁸](#ref-168)
4.  **Ongoing Study**: You have the grammar of the faith. Now, read the great books. Read the Church Fathers, the doctors of the Church, the great encyclicals. Challenge yourself intellectually.
5.  **Mission**: See your studies or your work not just as a career, but as your mission field. Excel in competence and radiate charity. Be the person in your workplace or university that people come to when they are in crisis, because they sense a peace and a solidity in you.
