## Overview

The transition to adulthood represents both an end and a beginning. While formal catechetical instruction may conclude, the journey of faith continues and deepens. This section addresses:

- **Letting go**: Supporting children as they become independent adults
- **Vocational discernment**: Helping young people discover their unique call
- **Adult formation**: Continuing to grow in faith throughout life
- **Intergenerational transmission**: Passing faith to future generations
